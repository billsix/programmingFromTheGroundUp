Dealing with Files
==================

A lot of computer programming deals with files. After all, when we
reboot our computers, the only thing that remains from previous sessions
are the things that have been put on disk. Data which is stored in files
is called *persistent* data, because it persists in files that remain on
the disk even when the program isn't running..

The UNIX File Concept
---------------------

Each operating system has its own way of dealing with files. However,
the UNIX method, which is used on Linux, is the simplest and most
universal. UNIX files, no matter what program created them, can all be
accessed as a sequential stream of bytes. When you access a file, you
start by opening it by name. The operating system then gives you a
number, called a *file descriptor*, which you use to refer to the file
until you are through with it. You can then read and write to the file
using its file descriptor. When you are done reading and writing, you
then close the file, which then makes the file descriptor useless.

In our programs we will deal with files in the following ways:

1. Tell Linux the name of the file to open, and in what mode you want it
   opened (read, write, both read and write, create it if it doesn't
   exist, etc.). This is handled with the ``open`` system call,
   which takes a filename, a number representing the mode, and a
   permission set as its parameters. %eax; will hold the
   system call number, which is 5. The address of the first character of
   the filename should be stored in %ebx;. The read/write
   intentions, represented as a number, should be stored in
   %ecx;. For now, use 0 for files you want to read from,
   and 03101 for files you want to write to (you must include the
   leading zero). [1]_ Finally, the permission set should be stored as a
   number in %edx;. If you are unfamiliar with UNIX
   permissions, just use 0666 for the permissions (again, you must
   include the leading zero).

2. Linux will then return to you a file descriptor in
   %eax;. Remember, this is a number that you use to
   refer to this file throughout your program.

3. Next you will operate on the file doing reads and/or writes, each
   time giving Linux the file descriptor you want to use. ``read``
   is system call 3, and to call it you need to have the file descriptor
   in %ebx;, the address of a buffer for storing the data that is
   read in %ecx;, and the size of the buffer in %edx;.
   Buffers will be explained in `Buffers and <#buffersbss>`__ . ``read``
   will return with either the number of characters read from the file,
   or an error code. Error codes can be distinguished because they are
   always negative numbers (more information on negative numbers can be
   found in :ref:`countingchapter`). ``write`` is system call
   4, and it requires the same parameters as the ``read`` system call,
   except that the buffer should already be filled with the data to
   write out. The ``write`` system call will give back the number of
   bytes written in %eax; or an error code.

4. When you are through with your files, you can then tell Linux to
   close them. Afterwards, your file descriptor is no longer valid. This
   is done using ``close``, system call 6. The only parameter to
   ``close`` is the file descriptor, which is placed in %ebx;

.. _buffersbss:

Buffers and ``.bss``
--------------------

In the previous section we mentioned buffers without explaining what
they were. A buffer is a continuous block of bytes used for bulk data
transfer. When you request to read a file, the operating system needs to
have a place to store the data it reads. That place is called a buffer.
Usually buffers are only used to store data temporarily, and it is then
read from the buffers and converted to a form that is easier for the
programs to handle. Our programs won't be complicated enough to need
that done. For an example, let's say that you want to read in a single
line of text from a file but you do not know how long that line is. You
would then simply read a large number of bytes/characters from the file
into a buffer, look for the end-of-line character, and copy all of the
characters to that end-of-line character to another location. If you
didn't find an end-of-line character, you would allocate another buffer
and continue reading. You would probably wind up with some characters
left over in your buffer in this case, which you would use as the
starting point when you next need data from the file. [2]_

Another thing to note is that buffers are a fixed size, set by the
programmer. So, if you want to read in data 500 bytes at a time, you
send the ``read`` system call the address of a 500-byte unused location,
and send it the number 500 so it knows how big it is. You can make it
smaller or bigger, depending on your application's needs.

To create a buffer, you need to either reserve static or dynamic
storage. Static storage is what we have talked about so far, storage
locations declared using ``.long`` or ``.byte`` directives. Dynamic
storage will be discussed in :ref:`dynamicmemory`. There are
problems, though, with declaring buffers using ``.byte``. First, it
is tedious to type. You would have to type 500 numbers after the
``.byte`` declaration, and they wouldn't be used for anything but to
take up space. Second, it uses up space in the executable. In the
examples we've used so far, it doesn't use up too much, but that can
change in larger programs. If you want 500 bytes you have to type in 500
numbers and it wastes 500 bytes in the executable. There is a solution
to both of these. So far, we have discussed two program sections, the
``.text`` and the ``.data`` sections. There is another section
called the ``.bss``. This section is like the data section, except
that it doesn't take up space in the executable. This section can
reserve storage, but it can't initialize it. In the ``.data`` section,
you could reserve storage and set it to an initial value. In the
``.bss`` section, you can't set an initial value. This is useful for
buffers because we don't need to initialize them anyway, we just need to
reserve storage. In order to do this, we do the following commands:

::

   .section .bss
       .lcomm my_buffer, 500

This directive, ``.lcomm``, will create a symbol, ``my_buffer``,
that refers to a 500-byte storage location that we can use as a buffer.
We can then do the following, assuming we have opened a file for reading
and have placed the file descriptor in %ebx;:

::

       movl $my_buffer, %ecx
       movl 500, %edx
       movl 3, %eax
       int  $0x80

This will read up to 500 bytes into our buffer. In this example, I
placed a dollar sign in front of ``my_buffer``. Remember that the reason
for this is that without the dollar sign, ``my_buffer`` is treated as a
memory location, and is accessed in direct addressing mode. The dollar
sign switches it to immediate mode addressing, which actually loads the
number represented by ``my_buffer`` itself (i.e. - the address of the
start of our buffer, which is the address of ``my_buffer``) into
%ecx;.

Standard and Special Files
--------------------------

You might think that programs start without any files open by default.
This is not true. Linux programs usually have at least three open file
descriptors when they begin. They are:

STDIN
   This is the *standard input*. It is a read-only file, and usually
   represents your keyboard. [3]_ This is always file descriptor 0.

STDOUT
   This is the *standard output*. It is a write-only file, and usually
   represents your screen display. This is always file descriptor 1.

STDERR
   This is your *standard error*. It is a write-only file, and usually
   represents your screen display. Most regular processing output goes
   to ``STDOUT``, but any error messages that come up in the process go
   to ``STDERR``. This way, if you want to, you can split them up into
   separate places. This is always file descriptor 2.

Any of these "files" can be redirected from or to a real file, rather
than a screen or a keyboard. This is outside the scope of this book, but
any good book on the UNIX command-line will describe it in detail. The
program itself does not even need to be aware of this indirection - it
can just use the standard file descriptors as usual.

Notice that many of the files you write to aren't files at all.
UNIX-based operating systems treat all input/output systems as files.
Network connections are treated as files, your serial port is treated
like a file, even your audio devices are treated as files. Communication
between processes is usually done through special files called pipes.
Some of these files have different methods of opening and creating them
than regular files (i.e. - they don't use the ``open`` system call), but
they can all be read from and written to using the standard ``read`` and
``write`` system calls.

Using Files in a Program
------------------------

We are going to write a simple program to illustrate these concepts. The
program will take two files, and read from one, convert all of its
lower-case letters to upper-case, and write to the other file. Before we
do so, let's think about what we need to do to get the job done:

-  Have a function that takes a block of memory and converts it to
   upper-case. This function would need an address of a block of memory
   and its size as parameters.

-  Have a section of code that repeatedly reads in to a buffer, calls
   our conversion function on the buffer, and then writes the buffer
   back out to the other file.

-  Begin the program by opening the necessary files.

Notice that I've specified things in reverse order that they will be
done. That's a useful trick in writing complex programs - first decide
the meat of what is being done. In this case, it's converting blocks of
characters to upper-case. Then, you think about what all needs to be
setup and processed to get that to happen. In this case, you have to
open files, and continually read and write blocks to disk. One of the
keys of programming is continually breaking down problems into smaller
and smaller chunks until it's small enough that you can easily solve the
problem. Then you can build these chunks back up until you have a
working program. [4]_

You may have been thinking that you will never remember all of these
numbers being thrown at you - the system call numbers, the interrupt
number, etc. In this program we will also introduce a new directive,
``.equ`` which should help out. ``.equ`` allows you to assign names
to numbers. For example, if you did ``.equ LINUX_SYSCALL, 0x800x80``,
any time after that you wrote ``LINUX_SYSCALL``, the assembler would
substitue ``0x80`` for that. So now, you can write

::

   int $LINUX_SYSCALL

which is much easier to read, and much easier to remember. Coding is
complex, but there are a lot of things we can do like this to make it
easier.

Here is the program. Note that we have more labels than we actually use
for jumps, because some of them are just there for clarity. Try to trace
through the program and see what happens in various cases. An in-depth
explanation of the program will follow.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/toupper-nomm-simplified.s
   :language: asm
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/toupper-nomm-simplified.s


Type in this program as ``toupper.s``, and then enter in the following
commands:

::

   as toupper.s -o toupper.o
   ld toupper.o -o toupper

This builds a program called ``toupper``, which converts all of the
lowercase characters in a file to uppercase. For example, to convert the
file ``toupper.s`` to uppercase, type in the following command:

::

   ./toupper toupper.s toupper.uppercase

You will now find in the file ``toupper.uppercase`` an uppercase version
of your original file.

Let's examine how the program works.

The first section of the program is marked ``CONSTANTS``. In
programming, a constant is a value that is assigned when a program
assembles or compiles, and is never changed. I make a habit of placing
all of my constants together at the beginning of the program. It's only
necessary to declare them before you use them, but putting them all at
the beginning makes them easy to find. Making them all upper-case makes
it obvious in your program which values are constants and where to find
them. [5]_ In assembly language, we declare constants with the
``.equ`` directive as mentioned before. Here, we simply give names
to all of the standard numbers we've used so far, like system call
numbers, the syscall interrupt number, and file open options.

The next section is marked ``BUFFERS``. We only use one buffer in this
program, which we call ``BUFFER_DATA``. We also define a constant,
``BUFFER_SIZE``, which holds the size of the buffer. If we always refer
to this constant rather than typing out the number 500 whenever we need
to use the size of the buffer, if it later changes, we only need to
modify this value, rather than having to go through the entire program
and changing all of the values individually.

Instead of going on to the ``_start`` section of the program, go to the
end where we define the ``convert_to_upper`` function. This is the part
that actually does the conversion.

This section begins with a list of constants that we will use The reason
these are put here rather than at the top is that they only deal with
this one function. We have these definitions:

::

       .equ  LOWERCASE_A, 'a'
       .equ  LOWERCASE_Z, 'z'
       .equ  UPPER_CONVERSION, 'A' - 'a'

The first two simply define the letters that are the boundaries of what
we are searching for. Remember that in the computer, letters are
represented as numbers. Therefore, we can use ``LOWERCASE_A`` in
comparisons, additions, subtractions, or anything else we can use
numbers in. Also, notice we define the constant ``UPPER_CONVERSION``.
Since letters are represented as numbers, we can subtract them.
Subtracting an upper-case letter from the same lower-case letter gives
us how much we need to add to a lower-case letter to make it upper case.
If that doesn't make sense, look at the ASCII code tables themselves
(see :ref:`asciilisting`). You'll notice that the number for the
character ``A`` is 65 and the character ``a`` is 97. The conversion
factor is then -32. For any lowercase letter if you add -32, you will
get its capital equivalent.

After this, we have some constants labelled ``STACK POSITIONS``.
Remember that function parameters are pushed onto the stack before
function calls. These constants (prefixed with ``ST`` for clarity)
define where in the stack we should expect to find each piece of data.
The return address is at position 4 + %esp;, the length of the
buffer is at position 8 + %esp;, and the address of the buffer is
at position 12 + %esp;. Using symbols for these numbers instead
of the numbers themselves makes it easier to see what data is being used
and moved.

Next comes the label ``convert_to_upper``. This is the entry point of
the function. The first two lines are our standard function lines to
save the stack pointer. The next two lines

::

       movl  ST_BUFFER(%ebp), %eax
       movl  ST_BUFFER_LEN(%ebp), %ebx

move the function parameters into the appropriate registers for use.
Then, we load zero into %edi;. What we are going to do is iterate
through each byte of the buffer by loading from the location
%eax; + %edi;, incrementing %edi;, and repeating
until %edi; is equal to the buffer length stored in %ebx;.
The lines

::

       cmpl  $0, %ebx
       je    end_convert_loop

are just a sanity check to make sure that noone gave us a buffer of zero
size. If they did, we just clean up and leave. Guarding against
potential user and programming errors is an important task of a
programmer. You can always specify that your function should not take a
buffer of zero size, but it's even better to have the function check and
have a reliable exit plan if it happens.

Now we start our loop. First, it moves a byte into %cl;. The code
for this is

::

       movb  (%eax,%edi,1), %cl

It is using an indexed indirect addressing mode. It says to start at
%eax; and go %edi; locations forward, with each location
being 1 byte big. It takes the value found there, and put it in
%cl;. After this it checks to see if that value is in the range
of lower-case *a* to lower-case *z*. To check the range, it simply
checks to see if the letter is smaller than *a*. If it is, it can't be a
lower-case letter. Likewise, if it is larger than *z*, it can't be a
lower-case letter. So, in each of these cases, it simply moves on. If it
is in the proper range, it then adds the uppercase conversion, and
stores it back into the buffer.

Either way, it then goes to the next value by incrementing %cl;. Next it
checks to see if we are at the end of the buffer. If we are not at the
end, we jump back to the beginning of the loop (the ``convert_loop``
label). If we are at the end, it simply continues on to the end of the
function. Because we are modifying the buffer directly, we don't need to
return anything to the calling program - the changes are already in the
buffer. The label ``end_convert_loop`` is not needed, but it's there so
it's easy to see where the parts of the program are.

Now we know how the conversion process works. Now we need to figure out
how to get the data in and out of the files.

Before reading and writing the files we must open them. The UNIX
``open`` system call is what handles this. It takes the following
parameters:

-  %eax; contains the system call number as usual - 5 in
   this case.

-  %ebx; contains a pointer to a string that is the name
   of the file to open. The string must be terminated with the null
   character.

-  %ecx; contains the options used for opening the file.
   These tell Linux how to open the file. They can indicate things such
   as open for reading, open for writing, open for reading and writing,
   create if it doesn't exist, delete the file if it already exists,
   etc. We will not go into how to create the numbers for the options
   until :ref:`truthbinarynumbers`. For now, just trust the numbers
   we come up with.

-  %edx; contains the permissions that are used to open
   the file. This is used in case the file has to be created first, so
   Linux knows what permissions to create the file with. These are
   expressed in octal, just like regular UNIX permissions. [6]_

After making the system call, the file descriptor of the newly-opened
file is stored in %eax;.

So, what files are we opening? In this example, we will be opening the
files specified on the command-line. Fortunately, command-line
parameters are already stored by Linux in an easy-to-access location,
and are already null-terminated. When a Linux program begins, all
pointers to command-line arguments are stored on the stack. The number
of arguments is stored at ``(%esp)``, the name of the program is stored
at ``4(%esp)``, and the arguments are stored from ``8(%esp)`` on. In the
C Programming language, this is referred to as the ``argv`` array,
so we will refer to it that way in our program.

The first thing our program does is save the current stack position in
%ebp; and then reserve some space on the stack to store the file
descriptors. After this, it starts opening files.

The first file the program opens is the input file, which is the first
command-line argument. We do this by setting up the system call. We put
the file name into %ebx;, the read-only mode number into
%ecx;, the default mode of ``$0666`` into
%edx;, and the system call number into
%eax; After the system call, the file is open and the
file descriptor is stored in %eax;. [7]_ The file
descriptor is then transferred to its appropriate place on the stack.

The same is then done for the output file, except that it is created
with a write-only, create-if-doesn't-exist, truncate-if-does-exist mode.
Its file descriptor is stored as well.

Now we get to the main part - the read/write loop. Basically, we will
read fixed-size chunks of data from the input file, call our conversion
function on it, and write it back to the output file. Although we are
reading fixed-size chunks, the size of the chunks don't matter for this
program - we are just operating on straight sequences of characters. We
could read it in with as little or as large of chunks as we want, and it
still would work properly.

The first part of the loop is to read the data. This uses the
``read`` system call. This call just takes a file descriptor to read
from, a buffer to write into, and the size of the buffer (i.e. - the
maximum number of bytes that could be written). The system call returns
the number of bytes actually read, or end-of-file (the number 0).

After reading a block, we check %eax; for an end-of-file
marker. If found, it exits the loop. Otherwise we keep on going.

After the data is read, the ``convert_to_upper`` function is called with
the buffer we just read in and the number of characters read in the
previous system call. After this function executes, the buffer should be
capitalized and ready to write out. The registers are then restored with
what they had before.

Finally, we issue a ``write`` system call, which is exactly like
the ``read`` system call, except that it moves the data from the buffer
out to the file. Now we just go back to the beginning of the loop.

After the loop exits (remember, it exits if, after a read, it detects
the end of the file), it simply closes its file descriptors and exits.
The close system call just takes the file descriptor to close in
%ebx;.

The program is then finished!

   section?

-  What are the system calls related to reading and writing files?

Use the Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Modify the ``toupper`` program so that it reads from ``STDIN`` and
   writes to ``STDOUT`` instead of using the files on the command-line.

-  Change the size of the buffer.

-  Rewrite the program so that it uses storage in the ``.bss`` section
   rather than the stack to store the file descriptors.

-  Write a program that will create a file called ``heynow.txt`` and
   write the words "Hey diddle diddle!" into it.

Going Further
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  What difference does the size of the buffer make?

-  What error results can be returned by each of these system calls?

-  Make the program able to either operate on command-line arguments or
   use ``STDIN`` or ``STDOUT`` based on the number of command-line
   arguments specified by ``ARGC``.

-  Modify the program so that it checks the results of each system call,
   and prints out an error message to ``STDOUT`` when it occurs.

   This will be explained in more detail in
   :ref:`truthbinarynumbers`.

.. [2]
   While this sounds complicated, most of the time in programming you
   will not need to deal directly with buffers and file descriptors. In
   :ref:`linking` you will learn how to use existing code present in
   Linux to handle most of the complications of file input/output for
   you.

.. [3]
   As we mentioned earlier, in Linux, almost everything is a "file".
   Your keyboard input is considered a file, and so is your screen
   display.

.. [4]
   Maureen Sprankle's Problem Solving and Programming Concepts is an
   excellent book on the problem-solving process applied to computer
   programming.

.. [5]
   This is fairly standard practice among programmers in all languages.

.. [6]
   If you aren't familiar with UNIX permissions, just put ``$0666``
   here. Don't forget the leading zero, as it means that the number is
   an octal number.

.. [7]
   Notice that we don't do any error checking on this. That is done just
   to keep the program simple. In normal programs, every system call
   should normally be checked for success or failure. In failure cases,
   %eax; will hold an error code instead of a return value. Error
   codes are negative, so they can be detected by comparing
   %eax; to zero and jumping if it is less than zero.
