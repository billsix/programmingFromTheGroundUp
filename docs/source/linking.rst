Sharing Functions with Code Libraries
=====================================

By now you should realize that the computer has to do a lot of work even
for simple tasks. Because of that, you have to do a lot of work to write
the code for a computer to even do simple tasks. In addition,
programming tasks are usually not very simple. Therefore, we neeed a way
to make this process easier on ourselves. There are several ways to do
this, including:

-  Write code in a high-level language instead of assembly language

-  Have lots of pre-written code that you can cut and paste into your
   own programs

-  Have a set of functions on the system that are shared among any
   program that wishes to use it

All three of these are usually used to some degree in any given project.
The first option will be explored further in
:ref:`highlevellanguages`. The second option is useful but it
suffers from some drawbacks, including:

-  Code that is copied often has to be majorly modified to fit the
   surrounding code.

-  Every program containing the copied code has the same code in it,
   thus wasting a lot of space.

-  If a bug is found in any of the copied code it has to be fixed in
   every application program.

Therefore, the second option is usually used sparingly. It is usually
only used in cases where you copy and paste skeleton code for a specific
type of task, and add in your program-specific details. The third option
is the one that is used the most often. The third option includes having
a central repository of shared code. Then, instead of each program
wasting space storing the same copies of functions, they can simply
point to the *dynamic libraries* which contain the functions they need.
If a bug is found in one of these functions, it only has to be fixed
within the single function library file, and all applications which use
it are automatically updated. The main drawback with this approach is
that it creates some dependency problems, including:

-  If multiple applications are all using the same file, how do we know
   when it is safe to delete the file? For example, if three
   applications are sharing a file of functions and 2 of the programs
   are deleted, how does the system know that there still exists an
   application that uses that code, and therefore it shouldn't be
   deleted?

-  Some programs inadvertantly rely on bugs within shared functions.
   Therefore, if upgrading the shared functions fixes a bug that a
   program depended on, it could cause that application to cease
   functioning.

These problems are what lead to what is known as "DLL hell". However, it
is generally assumed that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

In programming, these shared code files are referred to as *shared
libraries* , *dynamic libraries* , *shared objects*, *dynamic-link
libraries*, *DLLs*, or *.so files*. [1]_ We will refer to all of these
as *dynamic libraries*.

Using a Dynamic Library
-----------------------

The program we will examine here is simple - it writes the characters
``hello world`` to the screen and exits. The regular program,
``helloworld-nolib.s``, looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/helloworld-nolib.s
   :language: asm
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/hellowworld-nolib.s


That's not too long. However, take a look at how short
``helloworld-lib`` is which uses a library:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/helloworld-lib.s
   :language: asm
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/helloworld-lib.s


It's even shorter!

Now, building programs which use dynamic libraries is a little different
than normal. You can build the first program normally by doing this:

::

   as helloworld-nolib.s -o helloworld-nolib.o
   ld helloworld-nolib.o -o helloworld-nolib

However, in order to build the second program, you have to do this:

::

   as helloworld-lib.s -o helloworld-lib.o
   ld -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 \
      -o helloworld-lib helloworld-lib.o -lc

Remember, the backslash in the first line simply means that the command
continues on the next line. The option
``-dynamic-linker-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2`` allows our program
to be linked to libraries. This builds the executable so that before
executing, the operating system will load the program
``/lib/ld-linux.so.2`` to load in external libraries and link them with
the program. This program is known as a *dynamic linker*.

The ``-lc`` option says to link to the ``c`` library, named ``libc.so``
on GNU/Linux systems. Given a library name, ``c`` in this case (usually
library names are longer than a single letter), the GNU/Linux linker
prepends the string ``lib`` to the beginning of the library name and
appends ``.so`` to the end of it to form the library's filename. This
library contains many functions to automate all types of tasks. The two
we are using are ``printf``, which prints strings, and
``exit``, which exits the program.

Notice that the symbols ``printf`` and ``exit`` are simply referred to
by name within the program. In previous chapters, the linker would
resolve all of the names to physical memory addresses, and the names
would be thrown away. When using dynamic linking, the name itself
resides within the executable, and is resolved by the dynamic linker
when it is run. When the program is run by the user, the dynamic linker
loads the dynamic libraries listed in our link statement, and then finds
all of the function and variable names that were named by our program
but not found at link time, and matches them up with corresponding
entries in the shared libraries it loads. It then replaces all of the
names with the addresses which they are loaded at. This sounds
time-consuming. It is to a small degree, but it only happens once - at
program startup time.

How Dynamic Libraries Work
--------------------------

In our first programs, all of the code was contained within the source
file. Such programs are called *statically-linked executables*, because
they contained all of the necessary functionality for the program that
wasn't handled by the kernel. In the programs we wrote in
:ref:`records`, we used both our main program file and files
containing routines used by multiple programs. In these cases, we
combined all of the code together using the linker at link-time, so it
was still statically-linked. However, in the ``helloworld-lib`` program,
we started using dynamic libraries. When you use dynamic libraries, your
program is then *dynamically-linked*, which means that not all of the
code needed to run the program is actually contained within the program
file itself, but in external libraries.

When we put the ``-lc`` on the command to link the ``helloworld``
program, it told the linker to use the ``c`` library (``libc.so``) to
look up any symbols that weren't already defined in ``helloworld.o``.
However, it doesn't actually add any code to our program, it just notes
in the program where to look. When the ``helloworld`` program begins,
the file ``/lib/ld-linux.so.2`` is loaded first. This
is the dynamic linker. This looks at our ``helloworld`` program and sees
that it needs the ``c`` library to run. So, it searches for a file
called ``libc.so`` in the standard places (listed in
``/etc/ld.so.conf`` and in the contents of the
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable), then looks in
it for all the needed symbols (``printf`` and ``exit`` in this case),
and then loads the library into the program's virtual memory. Finally,
it replaces all instances of ``printf`` in the program with the actual
location of ``printf`` in the library.

Run the following command:

::

   lddldd ./helloworld-nolib

It should report back ``not a dynamic executable``. This is just like we
said - ``helloworld-nolib`` is a statically-linked executable. However,
try this:

::

   ldd ./helloworld-lib

It will report back something like

::

         libc.so.6 => /libc.so.6 (0x4001d000)
         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x400000000)

The numbers in parenthesis may be different on your system. This means
that the program ``helloworld`` is linked to ``libc.so.6`` (the ``.6``
is the version number), which is found at ``/libc.so.6``, and
``/lib/ld-linux.so.2`` is found at ``/lib/ld-linux.so.2``. These
libraries have to be loaded before the program can be run. If you are
interested, run the ``ldd`` program on various programs that are on your
Linux distribution, and see what libraries they rely on.

Finding Information about Libraries
-----------------------------------

Okay, so now that you know about libraries, the question is, how do you
find out what libraries you have on your system and what they do? Well,
let's skip that question for a minute and ask another question: How do
programmers describe functions to each other in their documentation?
Let's take a look at the function ``printf``. Its calling interface
(usually referred to as a *prototype*) looks like this:

::

   int printf(char *string, ...);

In Linux, functions are described in the C programming language. In
fact, most Linux programs are written in C. That is why most
documentation and binary compatibility is defined using the C language.
The interface to the ``printf`` function above is described using the C
programming language.

This definition means that there is a function ``printf``. The things
inside the parenthesis are the function's parameters or arguments. The
first parameter here is ``char *string``. This means there is a
parameter named ``string`` (the name isn't important, except to use for
talking about it), which has a type ``char *``. ``char`` means that
it wants a single-byte character. The ``**`` after it means that it
doesn't actually want a character as an argument, but instead it wants
the address of a character or sequence of characters. If you look back
at our ``helloworld program``, you will notice that the function call
looked like this:

::

       pushl $hello
       call  printf

So, we pushed the address of the ``hello`` string, rather than the
actual characters. You might notice that we didn't push the length of
the string. The way that ``printf`` found the end of the string
was because we ended it with a null character (``\0``). Many functions
work that way, especially C language functions. The ``int`` before
the function definition tell what type of value the function will return
in %eax; when it returns. ``printf`` will return an
``int`` when it's through. Now, after the ``char *string``, we have a
series of periods, ``......``. This means that it can take an indefinite
number of additional arguments after the string. Most functions can only
take a specified number of arguments. ``printf``, however, can take
many. It will look into the ``string`` parameter, and everywhere it sees
the characters ``%s``, it will look for another string from the stack to
insert, and everywhere it sees ``%d`` it will look for a number from the
stack to insert. This is best described using an example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/printf-example.s
   :language: asm
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/printf-example.s

Type it in with the filename ``printf-example.s``, and then do the
following commands:

::

   as printf-example.s -o printf-example.o
   ld printf-example.o -o printf-example -lc \
      -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2

Then run the program with ``./printf-example``, and it should say this:

::

   Hello! Jonathan is a person who loves the number 3

Now, if you look at the code, you'll see that we actually push the
format string last, even though it's the first parameter listed. You
always push a functions parameters in reverse order. [2]_ You may be
wondering how the ``printf`` function knows how many parameters
there are. Well, it searches through your string, and counts how many
``%d``\ s and ``%s``\ s it finds, and then grabs that number of
parameters from the stack. If the parameter matches a ``%d``, it treats
it as a number, and if it matches a ``%s``, it treats it as a pointer to
a null-terminated string. ``printf`` has many more features than this,
but these are the most-used ones. So, as you can see, ``printf`` can
make output a lot easier, but it also has a lot of overhead, because it
has to count the number of characters in the string, look through it for
all of the control characters it needs to replace, pull them off the
stack, convert them to a suitable representation (numbers have to be
converted to strings, etc), and stick them all together appropriately.

We've seen how to use the C programming language prototypes to call
library functions. To use them effectively, however, you need to know
several more of the possible data types for reading functions. Here are
the main ones:

``int``
   An ``int`` is an integer number (4 bytes on x86 processor).

``long``
   A ``long`` is also an integer number (4 bytes on an x86 processor).

``long long``
   A ``long long`` is an integer number that's larger than a ``long`` (8
   bytes on an x86 processor).

``short``
   A short is an integer number that's shorter than an ``int`` (2 bytes
   on an x86 processor).

``char``
   A ``char`` is a single-byte integer number. This is mostly used for
   storing character data, since ASCII strings usually are represented
   with one byte per character.

``float``
   A ``float`` is a floating-point number (4 bytes on an x86 processor).
   Floating-point numbers will be explained in more depth in
   :ref:`floatingpoint`.

``double``
   A ``double`` is a floating-point number that is larger than a float
   (8 bytes on an x86 processor).

``unsigned``
   ``unsigned`` is a modifier used for any of the above types which
   keeps them from being used as signed quantities. The difference
   between signed and unsigned numbers will be discussed in
   :ref:`countingchapter`.

``**``
   An asterisk (``*``) is used to denote that the data isn't an actual
   value, but instead is a pointer to a location holding the given value
   (4 bytes on an x86 processor). So, let's say in memory location
   ``my_location`` you have the number 20 stored. If the prototype said
   to pass an ``int``, you would use direct addressing mode and do
   ``pushl my_location``. However, if the prototype said to pass an
   ``int *``, you would do ``pushl $my_location`` - an immediate mode
   push of the address that the value resides in. In addition to
   indicating the address of a single value, pointers can also be used
   to pass a sequence of consecutive locations, starting with the one
   pointed to by the given value. This is called an array.

``struct``
   A ``struct`` is a set of data items that have been put together under
   a name. For example you could declare:

   ::

      struct teststruct {
          int a;
          char *b;
      };

   and any time you ran into ``struct teststruct`` you would know that
   it is actually two words right next to each other, the first being an
   integer, and the second a pointer to a character or group of
   characters. You never see structs passed as arguments to functions.
   Instead, you usually see pointers to structs passed as arguments.
   This is because passing structs to functions is fairly complicated,
   since they can take up so many storage locations.

``typedef``
   A ``typedef`` basically allows you to rename a type. For example, I
   can do ``typedef int myowntype;`` in a C program, and any time I
   typed ``myowntype``, it would be just as if I typed ``int``. This can
   get kind of annoying, because you have to look up what all of the
   typedefs and structs in a function prototype really mean. However,
   ``typedef``\ s are useful for giving types more meaningful and
   descriptive names.

.. note::

   The listed sizes are for intel-compatible (x86) machines. Other
   machines will have different sizes. Also, even when parameters
   shorter than a word are passed to functions, they are passed as longs
   on the stack.

That's how to read function documentation. Now, let's get back to the
question of how to find out about libraries. Most of your system
libraries are in ``/usr/lib`` or ``/lib``. If you want to
just see what symbols they define, just run
``objdump -R FILENAME`` where ``FILENAME`` is the full path to
the library. The output of that isn't too helpful, though, for finding
an interface that you might need. Usually, you have to know what library
you want at the beginning, and then just read the documentation. Most
libraries have manuals or man pages for their functions. The web is the
best source of documentation for libraries. Most libraries from the GNU
project also have info pages on them, which are a little more thorough
than man pages.

Useful Functions
----------------

Several useful functions you will want to be aware of from the ``c``
library include:

-  ``size_t strlen (const char *s)`` calculates the size of
   null-terminated strings.

-  ``int strcmp (const char *s1, const char *s2)`` compares two
   strings alphabetically.

-  ``char * strdup (const char *s)`` takes the pointer to a
   string, and creates a new copy in a new location, and returns the new
   location.

-  ``FILE * fopen (const char *filename, const char *opentype)``
   opens a managed, buffered file (allows easier reading and writing
   than using file descriptors directly). [3]_ [4]_

-  ``int fclose (FILE *stream)`` closes a file opened with
   ``fopen``.

-  ``char * fgets (char *s, int count, FILE *stream)`` fetches a
   line of characters into string ``s``.

-  ``int fputs (const char *s, FILE *stream)`` writes a string to
   the given open file.

-  ``int fprintf (FILE *stream, const char *template, ...)`` is
   just like ``printf``, but it uses an open file rather than defaulting
   to using standard output.

Building a Dynamic Library
--------------------------

Let's say that we wanted to take all of our shared code from
:ref:`records` and build it into a dynamic library to use in our
programs. The first thing we would do is assemble them like normal:

::

   as write-record.s -o write-record.o
   as read-record.s -o read-record.o

Now, instead of linking them into a program, we want to link them into a
dynamic library. This changes our linker command to this:

::

   ld -shared write-record.o read-record.o -o librecord.so

This links both of these files together into a dynamic library called
``librecord.so``. This file can now be used for multiple programs. If we
need to update the functions contained within it, we can just update
this one file and not have to worry about which programs use it.

Let's look at how we would link against this library. To link the
``write-records`` program, we would do the following:

::

   as write-records.s -o write-records
   ld -L . -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 \
      -o write-records -lrecord write-records.o

In this command, ``-L .`` told the linker to look for libraries in the
current directory (it usually only searches ``/lib`` directory,
``/usr/lib`` directory, and a few others). As we've seen, the
option ``-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2`` specified the dynamic
linker. The option ``-lrecord`` tells the linker to search for functions
in the file named ``librecord.so``.

Now the ``write-records`` program is built, but it will not run. If we
try it, we will get an error like the following:

::

   ./write-records: error while loading shared libraries:
   librecord.so: cannot open shared object file: No such
   file or directory

This is because, by default, the dynamic linker only searches ``/lib``,
``/usr/lib``, and whatever directories are listed in
``/etc/ld.so.conf`` for libraries. In order to run the
program, you either need to move the library to one of these
directories, or execute the following command:

::

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Alternatively, if that gives you an error, do this instead:

::

   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .

Now, you can run ``write-records`` normally by typing
``./write-records``. Setting ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` tells the linker to add
whatever paths you give it to the library search path for dynamic
libraries.

Review
------

Know the Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  What are the advantages and disadvantages of shared libraries?

-  Given a library named 'foo', what would the library's filename be?

-  What does the ``ldd`` command do?

-  Let's say we had the files ``foo.o`` and ``bar.o``, and you wanted to
   link them together, and dynamically link them to the library
   'kramer'. What would the linking command be to generate the final
   executable?

-  What is *typedef* for?

-  What are *struct*\ s for?

-  What is the difference between a data element of type *int* and *int
   \**? How would you access them differently in your program?

-  If you had a object file called ``foo.o``, what would be the command
   to create a shared library called 'bar'?

-  What is the purpose of LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

Use the Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Rewrite one or more of the programs from the previous chapters to
   print their results to the screen using ``printf`` rather than
   returning the result as the exit status code. Also, make the exit
   status code be 0.

-  Use the ``factorial`` function you developed in
   :ref:`recursivefunctions` to make a shared library. Then re-write
   the main program so that it links with the library dynamically.

-  Rewrite the program above so that it also links with the 'c' library.
   Use the 'c' library's ``printf`` function to display the result of
   the ``factorial`` call.

-  Rewrite the ``toupper`` program so that it uses the ``c`` library
   functions for files rather than system calls.

Going Further
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make a list of all the environment variables used by the GNU/Linux
   dynamic linker.

-  Research the different types of executable file formats in use today
   and in the history of computing. Tell the strengths and weaknesses of
   each.

-  What kinds of programming are you interested in (graphics,
   databbases, science, etc.)? Find a library for working in that area,
   and write a program that makes some basic use of that library.

-  Research the use of ``LD_PRELOAD``. What is it used for? Try building
   a shared library that contained the ``exit`` function, and have it
   write a message to STDERR before exitting. Use ``LD_PRELOAD`` and run
   various programs with it. What are the results?

.. [1]
   Each of these terms have slightly different meanings, but most people
   use them interchangeably anyway. Specifically, this chapter will
   cover dynamic libraries, but not shared libraries. Shared libraries
   are dynamic libraries which are built using *position-independent
   code* (often abbreviated PIC) which is outside the scope of this
   book. However, shared libraries and dynamic libraries are used in the
   same way by users and programs; the linker just links them
   differently.

.. [2]
   The reason that parameters are pushed in the reverse order is because
   of functions which take a variable number of parameters like
   ``printf``. The parameters pushed in last will be in a known position
   relative to the top of the stack. The program can then use these
   parameters to determine where on the stack the additional arguments
   are, and what type they are. For example, ``printf`` uses the format
   string to determine how many other parameters are being sent. If we
   pushed the known arguments first, you wouldn't be able to tell where
   they were on the stack.

.. [3]
   ``stdin``, ``stdout``, and ``stderr`` (all lower case) can be used in
   these programs to refer to the files of their corresponding file
   descriptors.

.. [4]
   ``FILE`` is a struct. You don't need to know its contents to use it.
   You only have to store the pointer and pass it to the relevant other
   functions.
