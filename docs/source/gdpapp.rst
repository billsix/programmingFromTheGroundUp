Using the GDB Debugger
======================

By the time you read this appendix, you will likely have written at
least one program with an error in it. In assembly language, even minor
errors usually have results such as the whole program crashing with a
segmentation fault error. In most programming languages, you can simply
print out the values in your variables as you go along, and use that
output to find out where you went wrong. In assembly language, calling
output functions is not so easy. Therefore, to aid in determining the
source of errors, you must use a *source debugger*.

A debugger is a program that helps you find bugs by stepping through the
program one step at a time, letting you examine memory and register
contents along the way. A *source debugger* is a debugger that allows
you to tie the debugging operation directly to the source code of a
program. This means that the debugger allows you to look at the source
code as you typed it in - complete with symbols, labels, and comments.

The debugger we will be looking at is GDB - the GNU Debugger. This
application is present on almost all GNU/Linux distributions. It can
debug programs in multiple programming languages, including assembly
language.

An Example Debugging Session
----------------------------

The best way to explain how a debugger works is by using it. The program
we will be using the debugger on is the ``maximum`` program used in
:ref:`firstprogs`. Let's say that you entered the program perfectly,
except that you left out the line:

::

       incl %edi

When you run the program, it just goes in an infinite loop - it never
exits. To determine the cause, you need to run the program under GDB.
However, to do this, you need to have the assembler include debugging
information in the executable. All you need to do to enable this is to
add the ``--gstabs`` option to the ``as`` command. So, you would
assemble it like this:

::

   as --gstabs maximum.s -o maximum.o

Linking would be the same as normal. "stabs" is the debugging format
used by GDB. Now, to run the program under the debugger, you would type
in ``gdb ./maximum``. Be sure that the source files are in the current
directory. The output should look similar to this:

::

   GNU gdb Red Hat Linux (5.2.1-4)
   Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public 
   License, and you are welcome to change it and/or 
   distribute copies of it under certain conditions. Type

   absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" 
   for details.  
   This GDB was configured as "i386-redhat-linux"...
   (gdb)

Depending on which version of GDB you are running, this output may vary
slightly. At this point, the program is loaded, but is not running yet.
The debugger is waiting your command. To run your program, just type in
``run``. This will not return, because the program is running in an
infinite loop. To stop the program, hit control-c. The screen will then
say this:

::

   Starting program: /home/johnnyb/maximum

   Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
   start_loop () at maximum.s:34
   34              movl data_items(,%edi,4), %eax
   Current language:  auto; currently asm
   (gdb)

This tells you that the program was interrupted by the SIGINT signal
(from your control-c), and was within the section labelled
``start_loop``, and was executing on line 34 when it stopped. It gives
you the code that it is about to execute. Depending on exactly when you
hit control-c, it may have stopped on a different line or a different
instruction than the example.

One of the best ways to find bugs in a program is to follow the flow of
the program to see where it is branching incorrectly. To follow the flow
of this program, keep on entering ``stepi`` (for "step
instruction"), which will cause the computer to execute one instruction
at a time. If you do this several times, your output will look something
like this:

::

   (gdb) stepi
   35              cmpl %ebx, %eax           
   (gdb) stepi
   36              jle start_loop            
   (gdb) stepi
   32              cmpl $0, %eax             
   (gdb) stepi
   33              je loop_exit
   (gdb) stepi
   34              movl data_items(,%edi,4), %eax
   (gdb) stepi
   35              cmpl %ebx, %eax           
   (gdb) stepi
   36              jle start_loop            
   (gdb) step
   32              cmpl $0, %eax             

As you can tell, it has looped. In general, this is good, since we wrote
it to loop. However, the problem is that it is *never stopping*.
Therefore, to find out what the problem is, let's look at the point in
our code where we should be exitting the loop:

::

   cmpl  $0, %eax
   je    loop_exit

Basically, it is checking to see if %eax; hits zero. If so, it
should exit the loop. There are several things to check here. First of
all, you may have left this piece out altogether. It is not uncommon for
a programmer to forget to include a way to exit a loop. However, this is
not the case here. Second, you should make sure that ``loop_exit``
actually is outside the loop. If we put the label in the wrong place,
strange things would happen. However, again, this is not the case.

Neither of those potential problems are the culprit. So, the next option
is that perhaps %eax; has the wrong value. There are two ways to
check the contents of register in GDB. The first one is the command
``info register``. This will display the contents of all
registers in hexadecimal. However, we are only interested in
%eax; at this point. To just display %eax; we can do
``print/$eax`` to print it in hexadecimal, or do ``print/d $eax``
to print it in decimal. Notice that in GDB, registers are prefixed with
dollar signs rather than percent signs. Your screen should have this on
it:

::

   (gdb) print/d $eax
   $1 = 3
   (gdb)

This means that the result of your first inquiry is 3. Every inquiry you
make will be assigned a number prefixed with a dollar sign. Now, if you
look back into the code, you will find that 3 is the first number in the
list of numbers to search through. If you step through the loop a few
more times, you will find that in every loop iteration %eax; has
the number 3. This is not what should be happening. %eax; should
go to the next value in the list in every iteration.

Okay, now we know that %eax; is being loaded with the same value
over and over again. Let's search to see where %eax; is being
loaded from. The line of code is this:

::

       movl data_items(,%edi,4), %eax

So, step until this line of code is ready to execute. Now, this code
depends on two values - ``data_items`` and %edi;. ``data_items``
is a symbol, and therefore constant. It's a good idea to check your
source code to make sure the label is in front of the right data, but in
our case it is. Therefore, we need to look at %edi;. So, we need
to print it out. It will look like this:

::

   (gdb) print/d $edi
   $2 = 0
   (gdb)

This indicates that %edi; is set to zero, which is why it keeps
on loading the first element of the array. This should cause you to ask
yourself two questions - what is the purpose of %edi;, and how
should its value be changed? To answer the first question, we just need
to look in the comments. %edi; is holding the current index of
``data_items``. Since our search is a sequential search through the list
of numbers in ``data_items``, it would make sense that %edi;
should be incremented with every loop iteration.

Scanning the code, there is no code which alters %edi; at all.
Therefore, we should add a line to increment %edi; at the
beginning of every loop iteration. This happens to be exactly the line
we tossed out at the beginning. Assembling, linking, and running the
program again will show that it now works correctly.

Hopefully this exercise provided some insight into using GDB to help you
find errors in your programs.

Breakpoints and Other GDB Features
----------------------------------

The program we entered in the last section had an infinite loop, and
could be easily stopped using control-c. Other programs may simply abort
or finish with errors. In these cases, control-c doesn't help, because
by the time you press control-c, the program is already finished. To fix
this, you need to set *breakpoints*. A breakpoint is a place in the
source code that you have marked to indicate to the debugger that it
should stop the program when it hits that point.

To set breakpoints you have to set them up before you run the program.
Before issuing the ``run`` command, you can set up breakpoints using the
``break`` command. For example, to break on line 27, issue the
command ``break 27``. Then, when the program crosses line 27, it will
stop running, and print out the current line and instruction. You can
then step through the program from that point and examine registers and
memory. To look at the lines and line numbers of your program, you can
simply use the command ``l``. This will print out your program with line
numbers a screen at a time.

When dealing with functions, you can also break on the function names.
For example, in the factorial program in :ref:`functionschapter`, we
could set a breakpoint for the factorial function by typing in
``break factorial``. This will cause the debugger to break immediately
after the function call and the function setup (it skips the pushing of
%ebp; and the copying of %esp;).

When stepping through code, you often don't want to have to step through
every instruction of every function. Well-tested functions are usually a
waste of time to step through except on rare occasion. Therefore, if you
use the ``nexti`` command instead of the ``stepi`` command,
GDB will wait until completion of the function before going on.
Otherwise, with ``stepi``, GDB would step you through every instruction
within every called function.

.. warning::

   One problem that GDB has is with handling interrupts. Often times GDB
   will miss the instruction that immediately follows an interrupt. The
   instruction is actually executed, but GDB doesn't step through it.
   This should not be a problem - just be aware that it may happen.
