    <para>
      本许可证是一种<quote>copyleft</quote>，其含义为:文档的衍生作品必须与原文档是同样自由的。本许可证是 GNU 通用公共许可证的补充，后者是为自由软件设计的一种 copyleft 许可证。

	<para><literal>2.原样复制</literal>
</para>

    <para>
      You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially 
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and 
the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are 
reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to 
those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or 
control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or 
distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If 
you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the 
conditions in section 3.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you 
may publicly display copies.

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</literal>
</para>
    <para>
      If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and 
the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the 
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: 
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back 
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the 
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with 
all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other 
material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the 
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these 
conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, 
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the 
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more 
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along 
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a 
publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete 
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general 
network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using 
public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must 
take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies 
in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus 
accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last 
time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or 
retailers) of that edition to the public.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the 
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them 
a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>4. MODIFICATIONS</literal>
</para>
    <para>
      You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the 
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified 
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the 
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the 
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do 
these things in the Modified Version:

	</formalpara>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>
      If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices 
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the 
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as 
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in 
the Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from 
any other section titles.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      You may add a section entitled <quote>Endorsements</quote>, provided it 
contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various 
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been 
approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a 
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of 
Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text 
and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) 
any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same 
cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you 
are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the 
old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the 
old one.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give 
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply 
endorsement of any Modified Version .

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</literal>
</para>

    <para>
      You may combine the Document with other documents released under this 
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, 
provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections 
of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant 
Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple 
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there 
are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, 
make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in 
parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if 
known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section 
titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the 
combined work.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled 
<quote>History</quote> in the various original documents, forming one 
section entitled <quote>History</quote>; likewise combine any sections 
entitled <quote>Acknowledgements</quote>, and any sections entitled 
<quote>Dedications</quote>.  You must delete all sections entitled 
<quote>Endorsements.</quote>

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</literal>
</para>
    <para>
      You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents 
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this 
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the 
collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim 
copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      You may extract a single document from such a collection, and dispbibute it 
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License 
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects 
regarding verbatim copying of that document.

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</literal>
</para>
    <para>
      A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and 
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the 
Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.  
Such a compilation is called an <quote>aggregate</quote>, and this License 
does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the 
Document , on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not 
themselves derivative works of the Document.  If the Cover Text requirement 
of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the 
Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's 
Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within 
the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole 
aggregate.

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>8. TRANSLATION</literal>
</para>

    <para>
      Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute 
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing 
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their 
copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant 
Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant 
Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you 
also include the original English version of this License. In case of a 
disagreement between the translation and the original English version of 
this License, the original English version will prevail.

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>9. TERMINATION</literal>
</para>
    <para>
      You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as 
expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, 
modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who 
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

    </para>
    
    <para><literal>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</literal>
</para>
    <para>
      The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU 
Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License 
<quote>or any later version</quote> applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of 
any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free 
Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of 
this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by 
the Free Software Foundation.

    </para>

    <para><literal>Addendum</literal>
</para>
    <para>
      To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the 
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices 
just after the title page:

    </para>
    
    <blockquote>
      <para>
	Copyright &copy; YEAR YOUR NAME.

      </para>
      <para>
	Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this 	document under 
the terms of the GNU Free Documentation 	License, Version 1.1 or any later 
version published by the 	Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant 
Sections being LIST 	THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, 
	and with the Back-Cover 	Texts being LIST.  A copy of the license is 
included in 	the section entitled <quote>GNU Free Documentation 
	License</quote>.

      </para>
    </blockquote>
      
    <para>
      If you have no Invariant Sections, write <quote>with no Invariant 
Sections</quote> instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no 
Front-Cover Texts, write <quote>no Front-Cover Texts</quote> instead of 
<quote>Front-Cover Texts being LIST</quote>; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

    </para>
    
    <para>
      If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend 
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software 
license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free 
software.
