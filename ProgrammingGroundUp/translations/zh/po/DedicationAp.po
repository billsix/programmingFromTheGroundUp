"Sunday School teachers, youth pastors, school teachers, friends, and other "
"relationships that God has brought into my life to lead me, help me, and "
"teach me are too many to count.  This book is dedicated to you all."

"First of all, I want to thank the members of the Vineyard Christian "
"Fellowship Church in Champaign, Illinois for everything that you have done "
"to help me and my family in our times of crisis.  It's been a long time "
"since I've seen or heard from any of you, but I think about you always.  You "
"have been such a blessing to me, my wife, and Daniel, and I could never "
"thank you enough for showing us Christ's love when we needed it most.  I "
"thank God every time I think of you - I thank Him for bringing you all to us "
"in our deepest times of need.  Even out in the middle of Illinois with no "
"friends of family, God showed that He was still watching after us.  Thank "
"you for being His hands on Earth.  Specifically, I'd like to thank Joe and "
"Rhonda, Pam and Dell, and Herschel and Vicki.  There were many, many others, "
"too - so many people helped us that it would be impossible to list them all."

"You all have given me the strength I needed to write this book over the last "
"few years.  Without your support, I would have been too overwhelmed by "
"personal crises to even think about anything more than getting through a "
"day, much less putting this book together.  You have all been a great "
"blessing to me, and I will keep you in my prayers always."
