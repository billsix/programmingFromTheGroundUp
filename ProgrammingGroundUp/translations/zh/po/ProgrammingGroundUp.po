"This book is not a reference book, it is an introductory book.  It is "
"therefore not suitable by itself to learn how to professionally program in "
"x86 assembly language, as some details have been left out to make the "
"learning process smoother.  The point of the book is to help the student "
"understand how assembly language and computer programming works, not to be a "
"reference to the subject.  Reference information about a particular "
"processor can be obtained by contacting the company which makes it."
