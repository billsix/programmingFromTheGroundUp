"</indexterm>programming.  I enjoy the challenge to not only make a working "
"program, but to do so with style.  Programming is like poetry.  It conveys a "
"message, not only to the computer, but to those who modify and use your "
"program.  With a program, you build your own world with your own rules.  You "
"create your world according to your conception of both the problem and the "
"solution.  Masterful programmers create worlds with programs that are clear "
"and succinct, much like a poem or essay."
msgstr "</indexterm>编程。我追求的往往不仅仅是解决问题本身，而且解决的方式要够酷。我很享受这样做带来的挑战。编程就像写诗。它传递着信息，不仅仅给电脑，还给那些修改和使用程序的人们。利用一个程序，你可以用你自己的规则组建你自己的世界，根据你对你的问题和解决方案的理解来创建你的世界。老道的程序员使用简单和紧凑的程序来创建世界，很像是诗和散文。"

"One of the greatest programmers, Donald Knuth, describes programming not as "
"telling a computer how to do something, but telling a person how they would "
"instruct a computer to do something.  The point is that programs are meant "
"to be read by people, not just computers.  Your programs will be modified "
"and updated by others long after you move on to other projects.  Thus, "
"programming is not as much about communicating to a computer as it is "
"communicating to those who come after you.  A programmer is a "
"problem-solver, a poet, and an instructor all at once.  Your goal is to "
"solve the problem at hand, doing so with balance and taste, and teach your "
"solution to future programmers.  I hope that this book can teach at least "
"some of the poetry and magic that makes computing exciting."
msgstr ""
"世界上最伟大的程序员之一，高德纳(Donald "
"Knuth)说，编程不是告诉计算机怎样去做一件事情，而是告诉一个人他们是如何让计算机去做一件事情。他的观点是，程序是被人来读的，而不仅仅是计算机。当你离开一个项目而去做其它的项目很久以后，你的程序也许还将会被其他人修改和升级。因此，编程不仅仅是和计算机进行交流，而且还要和那些接你班的人进行交流。一个程序员，既是一个问题的解决者，也是一个诗人，还是一个讲师。你的目标是解决眼前的问题，考虑周全而风格独具，并且能让未来的程序员学会你的解决方案。我希望这本书至少可以教给读者一些让计算兴奋的诗和魔法。"

"Most introductory books on programming frustrate me to no end.  At the end "
"of them you can still ask \"how does the computer really work?\" and not "
"have a good answer.  They tend to pass over topics that are difficult even "
"though they are important.  I will take you through the difficult issues "
"because that is the only way to move on to masterful programming.  My goal "
"is to take you from knowing nothing about programming to understanding how "
"to think, write, and learn like a programmer.  You won't know everything, "
"but you will have a background for how everything fits together.  At the end "
"of this book, you should be able to do the following:"

"There is somewhat of a chicken and egg problem in teaching programming, "
"especially assembly language.  There is a lot to learn - it is almost too "
"much to learn almost at all at once.  However, each piece depends on all the "
"others, which makes learning it a piece at a time difficult.  Therefore, you "
"must be patient with yourself and the computer while learning to program.  "
"If you don't understand something the first time, reread it.  If you still "
"don't understand it, it is sometimes best to take it by faith and come back "
"to it later.  Often after more exposure to programming the ideas will make "
"more sense.  Don't get discouraged.  It's a long climb, but very worthwhile."
msgstr "在教编程，特别是教汇编语言编程的时候，存在着一个类似先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题。有很多东西需要学习－多到以至于不可能一下子全学到手，只能一次学一点。但是每一点知识却又要依靠其他所有的知识，这样就使得学习起来非常困难。因此当学习编程的时候，你必须对你和计算机有耐心。如果你第一次不能理解某个问题，那就把这个问题再读一遍。如果你还不能理解他，比较好的办法是记住这个结论，等以后再回来理解它。通常随着你编程经验的不断增加，这些问题就能自然而然的理解了。不要气馁，学习编程是一个漫长的攀登过程，但是却非常值得。"

"At the end of each chapter are three sets of review exercises.  The first "
"set is more or less regurgitation - they check to see if can you give back "
"what you learned in the chapter.  The second set contains application "
"questions - they check to see if you can apply what you learned to solve "
"problems.  The final set is to see if you are capable of broadening your "
"horizons.  Some of these questions may not be answerable until later in the "
"book, but they give you some things to think about.  Other questions require "
"some research into outside sources to discover the answer.  Still others "
"require you to simply analyze your options and explain a best solution.  "
"Many of the questions don't have right or wrong answers, but that doesn't "
"mean they are unimportant.  Learning the issues involved in programming, "
"learning how to research answers, and learning how to look ahead are all a "
"major part of a programmer's work."
