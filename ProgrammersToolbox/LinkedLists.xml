<title>Programming with Lists</title>

<para>
List processing is one of the computer's biggest strengths.  Singly linked lists 
provide the basis for a number of interesting algorithms and techniques that are
useful in every aspect of programming.
</para>

<para>
This article will discuss only singly linked lists, and the
terms "linked lists" and "lists" will both
be used to mean singly linked lists.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Linked List Refresher</title>

<para>
A singly linked list is a data structure that has an ordered sequence of nodes, in which each node
contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.  Conceptually,
a singly linked list of integers looks like this in the computer's memory:
</para>

</mediaobject>

<para>
The arrows in this diagram represent pointers to the location of the next node in memory.
Notice that the order of the list is determined by the arrows, not by the memory locations
of the nodes.  Finally, the last node in the sequence simply has a mark, instead of an arrow, 
indicating that there are no more nodes in the list.  This marker is usually called the null value, the null list, or the null pointer.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>The Structure of List Nodes</title>

<para>
Coding linked lists is fairly simple.  In C++, the Standard Template Library includes an implementation of 
linked lists.  However, for the techniques we are going to learn, the Standard Template Library implementation
is not adequate.  Really, linked lists are pretty simple.  For example, the linked lists of integers in the diagram above could be represented by the following node structure in C:
</para>

<programlisting>
#define NULL 0
struct ll_int_node {
	int data;
	struct ll_int_node *next;
};
</programlisting>

<para>
Here we have a struct that includes the first element as a data item, and the second
element as a pointer to the next node.  <literal>NULL</literal> is defined as simply
a null pointer (0) because the null pointer is invalid as a pointer anyway.  To
have a variable hold this kind of list in a program, all we have to do is have a pointer 
that points to type <literal>struct ll_int_node</literal>. 
This pointer will point to the first
element (known as the head) of the list.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Common List Operations</title>

<para>
There are two basic update operations performed in standard linked list
implementations:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Inserting a node into the list</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Removing a node from the list</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
We are not going to spend much time analyzing these operations
because our approach to linked lists will be from a different
angle, which will be explained further on.
However, these methods are fairly
easily implemented by means of allocating/deallocating node structures, and then
modifying the pointers so that the given node is correctly sequenced in the list.
Conceptually, it's just a matter of moving the arrows.  Care must be taken, however,
to ensure that the head of the list is properly updated when inserts or removals change the list head.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>A More Generic List Structure</title>

<para>
It would be quite a pain if we had to come up with a different list node structure for
every type of data we wanted to store in lists, especially if
we wanted to store multiple types of data in a single list.  Therefore, we are going
to learn a more generic method of handling data.  This method
will allow us to store any data type in any node.
</para>

<para>
In order store arbitrary types of data within a node, we are going to define a structure that will be handled directly in the case of basic C data types, but will be handled via a pointer in cases of complex types.
In order to accomplish this, we will use <emphasis>typetags</emphasis>.  A typetag is an integer variable
where the value of the integer specifies the type of data 
being handled.   For basic C data types, the typetag lets us know
which data type is being used.  For complex data types we simply
use a pointer, and the typetag lets us know which type of
struct is being pointed to.
Here is the structure definition:
</para>

<programlisting>
typedef struct {
	int typetag;
	union {
		long long_member;
		double double_member;
		char char_member;
		void *pointer_member;
	};
} data;

/* Example declaration */
data my_data;
</programlisting>

<para>
In order to make this generic data structure useful, we have to come up with a typetag value for each type we
want, including pointer types.  Here is a full program that uses typetags to display
different types of data based on the typetag.
</para>

<programlisting>
#include "stdio.h"

/* Typetags for builtin types */
#define TYPETAG_LONG 1
#define TYPETAG_DOUBLE 2
#define TYPETAG_CHAR 3

/* The structure definition from before */
typedef struct {
	int typetag;
	union {
		long long_member;
		double double_member;
		char char_member;
		void *pointer_member;
	};
} data;

/* Example struct */
struct person {
	char name[200];
	char address[200];
};
/* Typetag for a pointer to our struct */
#define TYPETAG_PERSON_PTR 4

void display(data d)
{
	if(d.typetag == TYPETAG_LONG)
	{
		printf("%d\n", d.long_member);
	}
	else if(d.typetag == TYPETAG_PERSON_PTR)
	{
		struct person *p = (struct person *)d.pointer_member;
		printf("%s\n%s\n", p->name, p->address);
	}
	/* We could go on for each type, but this is good enough for an example */
}

int main()
{
	data my_data;
	data more_data;
	struct person *p;

	/* Use the "long" type */
	my_data.typetag = TYPETAG_LONG;
	my_data.long_member = 3;

	/* Use the "person" type */
	p = (struct person *)malloc(sizeof(struct person));
	strcpy(p->name, "Test");
	strcpy(p->address, "Test's Address");

	more_data.typetag = TYPETAG_PERSON_PTR;
	more_data.pointer_member = p;

	display(my_data);
	display(more_data);

	return 0;
}
</programlisting>

<para>
If we wanted to be more object-oriented, we could also use the typetag to be an index to an array of vtables.  Although an in-depth treatment of such a typetag is beyond the scope of this article, it does, nevertheless, indicate the potential power of typetags.  Our more primitive version still provides you with the concept of a single data structure that can encompass any number of data types.
</para>

<para>
Armed with this new generic data type, we can now make a very generic list node structure:
</para>

<programlisting>
struct generic_node {
	data the_data;
	struct generic_node *next;
};
</programlisting>

<para>
With this generic list node structure, we can now define lists and list operations that work regardless of the
type of data stored in them.  However, the typetag mechanism does incur a bit of 
overhead, but it is usually worth it compared to the frustration of recoding list after
list.  In C++, this overhead can be alleviated through templates.  In fact, if we create a generic
base class (like Java's Object class), we can actually use just the typing mechanisms of the C++ language rather than custom-implemented typetags.
That still falls a little short of the typetag mechanism, which does not have pointer overhead
for basic types, but works well if we are dealing with complex types, or if we do not mind
wrapping basic types in classes.

<title>Memory Management with Linked Lists</title>

<para>
In a <ulink url="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-memory/">previous article</ulink> various memory management techniques were discussed.  Although manual memory management with
linked lists is possible, it is not very friendly.
</para>

<para>
For example, when removing a node from a list, we have to remember to free the memory for the node structure.
That's not too bad.  However, if the data portion of the node is a pointer or contains
pointers, then we have a problem, especially if there is no
clear, universal memory management policy in effect for the 
program.  For example, if there is a policy that demands putting only <emphasis>copies</emphasis> of data structures, and not the original structures themselves,
into lists, then we can safely free the memory.
However, we will often want to increase speed and use less memory by just passing a
shared pointer.  In that case, memory management becomes much more difficult.
</para>

<para>
As a teaser, another issue with memory management comes from the idea of partial sharing
of list nodes, which we will discuss later.  If we are sharing nodes of a list, then removing
a list element, or even removing an entire list may not be grounds for freeing the memory if
it is in use elsewhere.
</para>

<para>
Because of these factors, the rest of the article will assume that you include a garbage
collector with your program.  Adding a garbage collector to your program is simple, and is
discussed in <ulink url="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-memory/">this article</ulink>.
This allows us to share data structure willy-nilly without worries of memory management problems
(and if you haven't shared data structures will-nilly, you're missing out).  Note that sharing
data structures can lead to other problems, if you're not careful.  Be sure you realize that
anytime you share a data structure through pointers, that an update to one of them affects the
other.

<title>Advanced List Programming Using Shared Sublists</title>

<para>
Now that we have a handle on linked lists, I want to point out a few interesting properties
of lists which we will exploit:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Since node structures only go in one direction, they know nothing about the sequence of nodes that preceded them.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Because nodes know nothing about the nodes that precede them, each node is itself the start of a list.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Because nodes know nothing about the nodes that precede them, a given list may actually be a sublist for many other lists.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
I know those sound confusing, so here are some examples of these statements:<remark>reword</remark>
</para>


<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="sharedlistexamples.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<caption><para><emphasis>Examples of List Sharing</emphasis></para></caption>
</mediaobject>


<para>
In this diagram, there are three lists.  The first list is the
sequence <literal>(1 57 26 9)</literal>.  From now on, we are going to
write our lists in parentheses to make them easier to read.  Now,
within that list are several sublists.  One in particular was marked
out in the diagram -- <literal>(57 26 9)</literal>.  However, 
<literal>(26 9)</literal>, <literal>(9)</literal> and
<literal>()</literal> (the empty list, or null list) are all also valid
sublists of the first list.  Because the arrows for the nodes only
point one direction, no modification to the data has to be made to use
a sublist.
</para>

<para>
In addition to plain sublists, the diagram also gives an example of
shared sublists.  The list <literal>(18 32 26 9)</literal> is actually
sharing the last two nodes with our original list.  That means that
any changes to the original list will affect this one as well.  That
also means that this list does not require additional memory for the
last two nodes.  In addition, this list may be a sublist for other
lists, and other lists may also use <literal>(26 9)</literal> as a
sublist.  As mentioned earlier, if you take advantage of shared lists,
you will definitely need a memory management strategy -- probably
garbage collection.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Using Sublists to Avoid Locking</title>

<para>
One advantage of linked lists is that you can use them to avoid
locking situations.  For example, let's say that you are programming a
game.  In this game, you maintain a list of every drawable object, and
you have the drawing thread running independently of the game thread.
Now, during your game you may need to add or remove objects from this
list from time to time.  While removing objects from the list requires
locking the list, adding items (like fired bullets) to the list does
not, if you add items to the front of the list.  The drawing thread
can simply iterate through the list of objects without worry, because
it knows that even if you add game objects during the drawing period,
they will not affect the nodes that are currently being drawn.  What
we are drawing will simply be a sublist of the new objects list.
</para>

<para>
This technique is effective anytime you have an unordered collection
that has to frequently be both iterated through and appended to.  As
long as you append to the front of the list, you won't have to even
touch the existing list structure, allowing other threads to iterate
through it freely.  Note, however, that if you were to add elements to
the end of the list, rather than at the front, you would be directly
modifying the list structure itself, and it could result in race
conditions if you are adding to the end of the list while someone is
iterating through it.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Using Shared Sublists for Undo Operations</title>

<para>
Shared sublists are quite useful for a number of applications, one of
which being undo operations.  If you structure your document as an
append-only linked list, it allows you to easily revert your changes
back to previous states.  For example, your document would look like
this: <literal>(modification3 modification2 modification1 original-document)</literal>.
This allows you to undo any change simply by moving the head of the list to a sublist.
Hitting "undo" twice would cause your document to look like this:
<literal>(modification1 original-document)</literal>.  You can also do multiple versions
of documents by creating branches which share a document from a specified point.  This
is the idea behind branches in CVS, for example.  You might have 
<literal>(branch-modification2 branch-modification1 modification1 original-document)</literal>
as a different set of modifications to the original document.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Using Lists to Represent Trees</title>

<para>
One other use for lists is to represent multi-noded trees.  Binary trees are represented by nodes which have a data value and a
left and right pointer.  However, there are many data structures which require trees that have more than just a left and right
branch.  In these cases, we find that lists are excellent representations of such trees.
</para>

<para>
It may appear that our list structure can only handle sequenced values.  They can also handle "inverted trees" by using shared sublists, 
but this is not what we are talking about here (if you have multiple lists sharing the same sublist, it looks like a tree graphically, but
since the lists only go in a straight sequence, you cannot access the other branches from any other branch).  However, to represent true
trees will require a different method.
</para>

<para>
We talked earlier about how to use tagged types to enable us to use any type of data in our node.  If we use that concept, we can
also store pointers to list nodes in our node, allowing us to have lists as the data for a list node.  Here's how it might look:
</para>


<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="listtreeexample.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<caption><para><emphasis>An example of a tree using linked lists</emphasis></para></caption>
</mediaobject>

<para>
Each node can either be a branch or a leaf.  We can represent this using our parenthetic notation by simply using lists as values
within our list.  This example would be represented this way: <literal>(((15 42) 22 18) 32 (6 2))</literal>.  If you take a moment
to examine it, you will find that it is really just a list of three elements, <literal>(element1 element2 element3)</literal>, where <literal>element1</literal>
is a list, <literal>element2</literal> is the number 32, and <literal>element3</literal> is the list <literal>(6 2)</literal>.  The list for <literal>element1</literal>
is itself a tree, where the first element is the list <literal>(15 42)</literal>, and the remaining two elements are <literal>22</literal> and <literal>18</literal>.
As you can see, using lists of lists, you can represent trees that have any number of branches and leaves.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Using Trees to Represent Syntax</title>

<para>
One great use of trees is representing the syntax of computer languages.  You can view computer languages as a hierarchical tree of language
constructs.  At the top is the whole program.  That program is composed of an arbitrary number of statements, which are composed of an arbitrary number
of expressions, which are themselves composed of an arbitrary number of expressions.  Thus, trees (specifically multinode trees) are ideal for representing
computer languages.
</para>

<para>
As a quick example, let's examine the parsing of an <literal>if</literal> statement.  <literal>if</literal> statements look like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
if(x > y)
{
	call_some_function(a, b, c);
}
</programlisting>

<para>
Our representation will have the first element of each list represent the language operator, action, or function call, and the remaining elements represent the arguments.
The parse tree for this might look something like this:
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="ifparse.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<caption><para><emphasis>An example of a parse tree using linked lists</emphasis></para></caption>
</mediaobject>

<para>
We would write this out as <literal>(if (> x y) (call_some_function a b c))</literal>.  Note that we always list the operators/functions first because when processing
the parse tree, you need to know what the operator or function you are dealing with before knowing the arguments.
</para>

<para>
What's really interesting is that a large part of the parse trees of different languages are actually very similar.  Most languages parse if statements and function
calls in basically the same way.  It would be really interesting if there were a language that operated directly on parse trees.  In fact, there is one, which the
next section will cover.
</para>

<title>Scheme - a Language for List Manipulation</title>

<para>
In this article, we have discussed several interesting features for lists and list manipulation.  We've discussed:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Using a list node data structure for lists</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Using typetags to allow list nodes and variables to store data of any arbitrary type</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Sharing lists and using sublists</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Using garbage collection to simplify memory management for lists</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Representing lists in parenthetical notation</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
While all of these are beneficial, they are somewhat tedious to actually pull off in the C programming language.  
Having to assign typetags, and to assign data to the appropriate member of the union is tedious.  Manually processing
list nodes can be tedious.  Using garbage collection can be easy or difficult depending on the garbage collector in use.
Parenthetical notation is nice, but you can't use it in th C language.  What would be nice is for a programming language 
to take all these techniques and make them an integral part of the language.  
</para>

<para>
Thankfully, that has already been done, and the language is Lisp.  Unfortunately, Lisp is a <emphasis>huge</emphasis> 
language.
</para>

<para>
Thankfully, there is a derivative of Lisp called Scheme, which is both powerful and very, very simple.  In fact, the standard
document, including the index, is only 50 pages.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>A quick introduction to Scheme syntax</title>

<para>
Scheme is almost entirely based on lists.  Scheme data comes in two varieties -- atoms and lists (there are also vectors, but they
are not discussed in this article).  An atom is a basic piece of data,
like a number, a string, or a character.  Lists are linked lists of atoms, lists, or both.  Even the programs you write in Scheme
are just lists which happen to be parse trees, like the ones we played with previously.  In fact, the example we looked at
is actually a valid scheme program.
</para>

<para>
Let's give a concrete, runnable scheme program: <literal>(if (> 7 5) (display "Hello There!\n"))</literal>
</para>

<para>
This program will compare 7 and 5, and since 7 is greater than 5, it will print "hello there!" to the screen.
To run a scheme program, you need a scheme interpretter.  If you are running Linux, you probably have the GUILE
scheme interpretter installed.  To run a scheme program using GUILE, just type in <literal>guile -s filename.scm</literal>.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Defining and Using Variables with Scheme</title>

<para>
A scheme program is just a collection of lists.  Each list is a parse tree that is run through Scheme's evaluator to
produce a result.  The evaluator has 4 basic cases that it handles:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Is the data a variable name?  If so, then look up the variable and return the value (in the case of function names, this returns the function)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Is the data a list?  If not, then it is just a constant value, so return it.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Is the first element of the list is the name of a <emphasis>special form</emphasis> (an operator that isn't a function)?  If so, then run the evaluator's internal procedure for that special form, and return the result.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Otherwise, run the evaluator on each element of the list.  The first element must evaluate to a function, and that function is called with the remaining list elements as arguments, and the result of the function is returned as the result.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
So first, we'll look at the special form that is used to define variables, appropriately called <literal>define</literal>.  Define statements look like this: <literal>(define variablename value)</literal>.  Subsequent changes to the variable are done using the <literal>set!</literal> special form.  It works just like <literal>define</literal> but is used after a variable is already defined.  To try
out these special forms, try entering in and running the following program:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define x 200) ;Sets x to be 200
(define y x) ;Sets y to be x, which is evaluated to 200
(define a 50) ;Sets a to be 50
(define b a) ;Sets b to be a, which is evaluted to 50
(set! b 300) ;Sets b to be 300.  Note that this does not affect the value of a
(display "x is ") ;display displays its argument, a string in this case
(display x) ;here, x is evaluated, and its result is displayed
(newline) ;newline just prints a newline
(display "y is ") ;now we are doing the same for the other variables
(display y)
(newline)
(display "a is ")
(display a)
(newline)
(display "b is ")
(display b)
(newline)
</programlisting>

<para>
As you might have guessed, <literal>display</literal> is a function that prints out its argument, and <literal>newline</literal> is a function that simply prints out an end-of-line character.
</para>

<para>
You can use any expression that you want as a value.  For example, you can use the addition function (called <literal>+</literal> in scheme) to calculate values.  You can even include the
<literal>if</literal> special form as part of an expression.  Here is another code example using these concepts:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define a 20) 
(define b (+ 20 a)) ;b is given the result of (+ 20 a).  Remember that the function name is always listed first in the list
(define c (if (> b a) b a)) ;read this as "if b is greater than a then b else a"
(define d (if (eq? c b) "B and C are equal" "B and C are not equal"))
(set! a (+ a a a)) ;a is tripled, and then a is set to the resulting value
(display "a is ") ;now we're just printing out all our variables
(display a)
(newline)
(display "b is ")
(display b)
(newline)
(display "c is ")
(display c)
(newline)
(display "d is ")
(display d)
(newline)
</programlisting>

<para>
Notice how I can stick any type of data into any variable.  In the previous program, I used both integer and string data, and never had
to tell the scheme language what type of data I was using.  Internally, Scheme uses typetags to differentiate between the different types of data.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Creating Lists with Scheme</title>

<para>
Of course, the whole reason of using Scheme in the first place is to handle list manipulations.  In Scheme, list nodes are called <emphasis>pairs</emphasis>.  They
are slightly different, because the bottom half of a pair doesn't have to be a pointer to a list node.  But for our uses, we will use pairs exactly like we
use list nodes.
</para>

<para>
Scheme defines a list as being either:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The null list</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A pair whose bottom half is a list</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
This means that the bottom half of a pair that's used in a list will always point to a list.  We know we're at the end of a list when we hit the
null list, written as <literal>()</literal>.
</para>

<para>
To create a list node in scheme, you use the <literal>cons</literal> function (which stands for <emphasis>construct</emphasis>).  <literal>cons</literal>
takes two arguments, the node data, and the list that the bottom half of the pair will point to.  If you are just starting a list, then you would use the
null list.  For example:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define myfirstschemelist (cons 23 '()))
</programlisting>

<para>
The single-quote in front of the null list is used to tell Scheme that we are using <literal>()</literal> as data, and not as a part of our parse tree.
<literal>cons</literal> is like a specialized malloc for Scheme pairs.  In addition, since Scheme is garbage collected, you never have to worry about 
freeing the pair.  Once you stop using it, the Scheme runtime will take care of it for you.
</para>

<para>
Here is a program that demonstrates creating a list in scheme of the numbers 3, 4, and 5:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define mylist '()) ;The null list is a list
(set! mylist (cons 5 mylist)) ;This constructs a new node with 5 as the data, and set! makes mylist now point to the new node
(set! mylist (cons 3 (cons 4 mylist))) ;This constructs two nodes in one statement.  The result of the second cons is used as the second argument of the first cons.
(display mylist) ; lets see what we've created!
(newline)
</programlisting>

<para>
Here we are going to demonstrate how this can be used to create shared sublists:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define a '(1 2 3)) ;remember, ' means to treat the list as data, so now the variable a contains (1 2 3)
(define b (cons "Hello" a)) ;remember, each list element can be of any type. 
(define c (cons 55 a)) ;Lists b and c are now both sharing list a as a sublist
(define d (cons 23 (cons "My name is Fred" (cons 22.5 b)))) ;This shared list b, which shares list a
;Let's print them out
(display "a is ")
(display a)
(newline)
(display "b is ")
(display b)
(newline)
(display "c is ")
(display c)
(newline)
(display "d is ")
(display d)
(newline)
</programlisting>

<para>
If you get confused, it might be worthwhile to draw out each list node.  Remember, <literal>cons</literal> creates list nodes.
</para>

<para>
Now, in order for lists to be useful, you have to be able to retrieve the data.  The function to retrieve the data from the first
element of a list is called <literal>car</literal> (the name is a holdover from an ancient assembly language instruction).  To
retrieve the next node of a list, you use the function <literal>cdr</literal> (note that this retrieves the entire node, not just
the value -- to get the value you would have to do a <literal>car</literal> on the result).
</para>

<para>
Add the following code to the previous program to see how <literal>car</literal> and <literal>cdr</literal> can be used:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define e (car d)) ;e now has the data of the first node of d
(define f (cdr d)) ;f now has the list starting AFTER the first node of d
(define g (car (cdr d))) ;g now has the data of the second node of d
(define h (car (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr d)))))) ;h now has hte data of the 5th node of d
(define i (cdr (cdr (cdr (cdr d))))) ;i now has the 4th sublist of d

(display "e is ")
(display e)
(newline)
(display "f is ")
(display f)
(newline)
(display "g is ")
(display g)
(newline)
(display "h is ")
(display h)
(newline)
(display "i is ")
(display i)
(newline)]

<title>Iterating Through Lists in Scheme</title>

<para>
In addition to the normal control structures available in other languages, Scheme has some
special ones specifically dealing with lists.  The most important one is <literal>map</literal>
which applies a function to every element of a list.  <literal>map</literal> is called like this:
<literal>(map function list-to-process)</literal>.  Therefore, in order to use <literal>map</literal>,
we have to know how to define functions.  In scheme, functions are defined using the <literal>lambda</literal>
special form.  <literal>lambda</literal> creates and returns a nameless procedure.  It can be given a name
using <literal>define</literal>, or just used in place.  The first argument to <literal>lambda</literal> is
the list of arguments the function can take.  The remaining arguments to <literal>lambda</literal> are the
expressions to be evaluated when the function is called.
</para>

<para>
Therefore, let's write a short function to add 2 to every element of a list, and return the resulting list:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define my-list '(1 2 3)) ;our original list
(define new-list 
  (map
    (lambda (x)   ;(x) is the argument list -- this takes one argument, called x
      (+ x 2)     ;add 2 to x and return the value
    )
    my-list       ;this is the list to run it on.
  )
)

(display "the original list is ")
(display my-list)
(newline)
(display "the resulting list is ")
(display new-list)
(newline)
</programlisting>

<para>
As you can see, this creates a brand new list that is the result of applying our function to every element of the original list.  
In addition, it leaves the original list unchanged.
</para>

<para>
As mentioned, you can also name your functions so that you can use them repeatedly:
</para>

<programlisting>
(define addtwo (lambda (x) (+ x 2)))
(display (addtwo 5))
(newline)
(display (map addtwo '(3 4 5)))
(newline)
</programlisting>

<para>
The Scheme language is a rich and powerful language for list manipulation, while still being easy to understand and grasp.  This has
been just a primer, to give you a taste of how easy list manipulation is in list-oriented languages like Scheme.  We achieved all of
the power of our C implementation without any of the difficulties of managing C structures, C memory, or of dealing directly with typetags.

<title>Conclusion</title>

<para>
Singly Linked Lists are a very powerful abstraction that allow you to represent numerous types of data.  Extending
it with arbitrary data types, garbage collection, and list-oriented syntax can give you a powerful method of processing
data.  When used with the list-oriented programming languages like scheme, the power of the list becomes not only 
powerful, but extremely easy to use.
