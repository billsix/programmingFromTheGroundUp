<title>Enterprise Metaprogramming</title>

<para>
Enterprise metaprogramming is becoming more and more common all the
time.  Graphical and textual utilities are making programming tasks
easier and more descriptive.  These utilities are becoming more
formalized under the OMG's Model Driven Architecture (MDA).  This
article will explore how far metaprogramming can take us, as well as
its limits.  It will describe the Model Driven Architecture and the
problems it solves, and present a short example of a textual system
that uses the Model Driven Architecture.
</para>


<sect1>
<title>Theoretical Limits of Metaprogramming</title>

<para>
Many people abhore the idea of theoretical discussions.  However, for
metaprogramming it is very important, because such a discussion will
aid in discerning the marketing claims of various metaprogramming
tools.  This is an area for which wild claims are sometimes made, and
it is difficult to see where problems can arise.  The focus of this
discussion is identifying both what the possibilities are for the
future of metaprogramming, and what its inherent limits are.  Knowing
both of these aid in choosing the right tools, as well as knowing what
questions to ask of vendors.  
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Graphical and Textual Metaprogramming</title>

<para>
The first two articles in this series focused on textual
metaprogramming systems.  However, there are many metaprogramming
systems which are graphical in nature.  Let's begin by
examining a program represented textually and graphically, and see
what the similarities and differences are.  For this example, we will
use regular expressions.
</para>

<para>
Regular expressions are basically a small sublanguage built for text
processing, used to match and replace strings of characters.  For
those of you not familiar with regular expressions, there are
tutorials listed in the <ulink url="#resources">Resources</ulink>
section.  Here is a small regular expression in Perl that will
substitute all <literal>&lt;h1&gt;</literal>'s with
<literal>&lt;h2&gt;</literal>'s in an HTML string:
</para>

<example>
<title>Perl Regular Expression for Substituting HTML Tags</title>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
$html_str =~ s!<(/?)h1>!<${1}h2>!g;
]]>
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>
The language for doing a regular expression is not Perl, it is a
domain-specific language that Perl happens to have a hook into.
However, the exact syntax of the regular expression is not that
important.  There are many other ways it could be written.  Basically,
whether you are communicating to the computer in a full-featured
programming language or a small domain-specific language, you have to
have some way of communicating to the compiler or interpretter the
symbols of that language.  We often do this by typing code, but there
is no technical reason for us to limit ourselves in such a way.  For
example, there is no technical reason (except that a parser simply
hasn't been written yet) that you could not express the above regular
expression like this:
</para>

<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="RegExDiagramScaled.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<caption><para><emphasis>A Perl Regular Expression as a Diagram</emphasis></para></caption>
</mediaobject>

<para>
This works not only for domain-specific languages, but also for
general programming languages.  Since compilers operate on symbols,
there is no constraint that the symbols have to come in as text --
they can just as easily appear graphically.  There are several reasons we
normally use text to program computers instead of graphics:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Typing is often faster than having to position
graphs</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The inertia of text-based programming systems (there
are millions of people already trained to do this, and thousands of
tools already capable of assisting you)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Textual forms are often easier to think about and
manipulate programmatically.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
In fact, for the case of regular expressions, it is fairly clear that
it will be more difficult to enter in the code graphically.  However,
note that in the two representations of the regular
expression, the same amount of <emphasis>programming information</emphasis> is present in
each graph.  This is the first main point I want to communicate: 
<emphasis>graphical representations of programming concepts do
not reduce the amount of programming involved</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
For some of you who have used visual tools for programming, this may
seem contrary to experience.  However, this is because of the benefits
of domain-specific languages, not specifically of the graphical
approach.  This is evidenced by an example from Windows programming.
Let's look at a Win32 resource script for building dialog boxes:
</para>

<example>
<title>Example Win32 Resource Script</title>
<programlisting>
IDD_TEST DIALOG DISCARDABLE 0, 0, 200, 200
STYLE DS_MODALFRAME | WS_POPUP | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU
CAPTION "Hello There!"
FONT 8, "MS Sans Serif"
BEGIN
DEFPUSHBUTTON "OK",IDOK,108,8,50,14
END
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>
Now, this requires the programmer to "put in" the same amount of
information as if I had used a graphical tool to build the dialog box
and position it.  The difference is that it is much easier to select
widgets and position them with a mouse than it is to type out their
names and then type in their coordinates, but the amount of
information conveyed by the programmer to the computer is the same in
both cases.  
</para>

<para>
So what is it that makes the operation easier?  It is the restricted,
domain-specific sublanguage that requires less programming, not the
visual or textual nature of the tool.  This brings the following
conclusions:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Domain-specific languages may reduce the amount of
programming involved.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Some domain-specific languages are easier to enter
textually, while others are easier to enter
graphically.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Whether a program in a domain-specific language is
entered textually or graphically, the same amount of information flows
from the programmer to the computer.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Because graphical languages still must provide symbols
to the computer for compilation or interpretation, graphical
specifications will still be required to follow formal language
parameters.  Such languages cannot be ad-hoc, any more than computer
languages can be.  Graphical representations will have just as
formalized of a graphical syntax and semantics as textual languages do.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<para>
Now although graphical representations of programs contain the same
amount of programmatic information as textual representations,
graphical representations can usually contain more non-programmatic
information, such as:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Different components can be spatially arranged to make
more sense to other people in a graphical environment.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Graphs, drawings, and other graphical explanatory
elements and visual cues can be added directly to the source code in a
graphical environment to help explain a process.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Code can be assigned to regions which are hidden or
exposed depending on the detail of the view (i.e. being able to hide
error-checking code when you just want to analyze the
algorithm).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Graphical models surely have the ability to take programming to a new
level.  However, it is not because less information is passed from the
programmer to the computer, but instead because more information can
be passed from programmer to programmer in a more natural way.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Metaprogramming, Programmers and Domain Experts</title>

<para>
Now that we've established that it is the domain-specific sublanguage
that reduced the amount of programming involved, not necessarily the
graphical nature, it is important to ask if we can ever reach a point
where programming is done completely by domain experts, skipping the
actual programmers to do the work, and letting the domain experts
simply use metaprogramming tools to design and build their entire
applications. 
</para>

<para>
To answer this question, the first thing to think about is this:  what
is it that programmers do for a programming project other than write
code?  In my own experience, the most important role of the
programmer/analyst is to identify all of the edge cases.  Programmers
tend to think about issues of process more methodically, and therefore
are often in the best position to help the domain expert identify and
expound upon all of the edge cases.  Domain experts, left to
themselves, will often leave large areas of the system underspecified,
no matter how hard they try.  Performing ad-hoc solutions is usually
just a part of doing business, and the need for absolute specification
is very far from their way of thinking.
</para>

<para>
The second thing that programmers do is they understand fully the
syntax, semantics, abilities, and limitations of the languages that
they program on.  As pointed out in the previous section, graphical
languages are no less subject to issues of exact semantics than
textual languages are, since they are both ultimately reduced to
symbols.  Therefore, even in the best, most simplified graphical
environments, it is still utterly necessary to have a full
understanding of the tool being used and its semantics.
</para>

<para>
Based on these two observations, I am confident that there will always
be a need for programmers as long as there are programs to write.
Now, there may come a day when programming is embedded enough into the
schools and curriculums that there won't be a need for programming as
a separate discipline.  In fact, I would welcome such a change.
However, that would mean that instead of programming being simplified
to a point where programmers are not needed, on the contrary, public
education would be expounded enough where such simplifications may not
need to be necessary!  The important point in all of this is that the
role of being a domain expert is and will continue to be separate from
the role of being a programmer, though those roles are sometimes
played by the same people.
</para>

<para>
Ultimately, graphical metaprograms are <emphasis>still
programs</emphasis>, and thus require a programmer to implement
correctly.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Working at Multiple Levels of Abstraction</title>

<para>
One of the biggest problems in metaprogramming is the fact that the
programmer almost always has to work in multiple levels of
abstraction.  This can sometimes make the job of the programmer
harder than it would be without the metaprogramming system, since the
programmer not only needs to know the details of how to program the
domain-specific languages and the general-purpose languages, but also
the details of how they are each implemented, how to communicate
between them, and what sort of impedance mismatches there are between
them. 
</para>

<para>
Often times, most of the code will be able to use the metaprogramming
tools available to accomplish the task.  But the hardest part comes
when they have to be mixed.  For example, if the metaprogramming
system auto-generates a method within a class, but later that method
must be tweaked.  The question then becomes, how does one implement
that?  In some instances and with some tools, modifying the generated
code immediately removes the program from within the purview of the
metaprogramming system.  The metaprogram is no longer of any use 
because the change must be made at a lower level.  There are some
solutions to this problem, but ultimately it is very difficult if not
impossible to solve completely.
</para>

<para>
The best systems are those which allow you to work at multiple levels
of abstraction within the metaprogramming system itself.  For example,
in the previous article we discussed that the Scheme macro system
allowed an easy mixing of macro and non-macro code.  Ultimately, what
is needed is the ability to work at both a high-level and a low-level
from within the metaprogramming tool itself, and simply mark for the
tool where you need to transition to a lower-level.
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>A High-level View of The Model Driven Architecture</title>

<para>
Hopefully you now have a better understanding of what is and isn't
possible with metaprogramming tools and why.  Now we will turn to
enterprise metaprogramming, and look and see how it is both similar
and different from other metaprogramming practices.
</para>

<para>
First of all enterprise metaprogramming ultimately is just
metaprogramming.  What differentiates ordinary metaprogramming from
enterprise metaprogramming are two things:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the problems that it tries to solve</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the cardinality of the relationship between source and
destination languages</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect2>
<title>Problems Solved by the Model Driven Architecture</title>

<para>
The first difference between traditional metaprogramming and
enterprise metaprogramming are the problems which are attempted to be
solved.  Traditionally, metaprogramming has been mostly about these
things:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>reducing the software development release cycle
length</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>forcing programs to follow system
constraints</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>make the programming language follow the domain model
more closely</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Enterprise metaprogramming involves these as well, but also adds other
considerations.
</para>

<para>
First of all, one problem has always been that models are often
developed at the beginning of a project, and then fall into
irrelevancy as the project progresses, because the realities of coding
mean that the model is not very accurate, and changing the model
continually will only make the project late.  It seems almost wasteful
to design a model at the beginning and then not use it.  It also seems
wasteful to develop a model once in a charting program, and then
re-develop it later as code.  Therefore, <emphasis>the Model Driven
Architecture aims to make the models developed at the beginning of the
project part of the code itself, both so that it stays current, and is
not redundant to the actually coding process</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Another problem is a related one, and it is that of communication.
Code is very difficult for a non-programmer to read.  However, if code
were written in a graphical manner, then it would be much easier to
discuss coding matters with non-coders.  Note that this would actually
make the code more difficult to develop, since aesthetics would have
to be included in the coding, but ultimately it would make the
communication between the programmer and the domain experts much more
efficient, as the domain expert could comment on the code itself,
represented in a graphical, domain-friendly nature.
</para>

<para>
Another problem is portability.  Businesses by their very nature often
use very different tools.  This is not necessarily because of a lack
of technological forethought, but is simply a reality of business.
First of all, many businesses purchase other businesses, and therefore
their IT must be mixed.  Second, there are so many small needs in
business that it is literally impossible for an IT department to come
up with a cohesive solution to every need.  Therefore, it should
simply be assumed that in a large organization there will be a diverse
set of technologies that must be brought together.  Because of this,
the metaprogramming system should be customizable to produce output
for a wide variety of systems.  This will be discussed later in
further detail.
</para>

<para>
The final problem is maintenance.  Ultimately, systems need to not
just be built, but be maintained.  Because the model is tied directly
into the code itself, maintenance becomes easier.  The programmers can
communicate to future programmers graphically, and use not only text,
but also graphics and charts to explain their programs.  In fact, in
many cases the graphs and charts will themselves be the program!
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Platform-specific and Platform-independent models</title>

<para>
The core concept which aims to solve or alleviate the above-mentioned
problems is the <emphasis>platform-independent model</emphasis>.  The
Model Driven Architecture has essentially three tiers:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>The Code</term>
<listitem><para>
Ultimately, all of our models will become code.  This is the
bottom-most tier of the Model Driven Architecture.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>The Platform-Specific Model</term>
<listitem><para>
The metaprogramming systems described in the previous articles are
essentially platform-specific models.  They are at a higher level than
the programming languages themselves, but ultimately are directly tied
to them.  The translation and relationship between the
platform-specific model and the code are usually fairly obvious.  This
model is often abbreviated as PSM.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>The Platform-Independent Model</term>
<listitem><para>
The Platform-Independent Model, often referred to as the PIM, is what
makes enterprise metaprogramming unique.  PIMs, as you may have
guessed, get translated into PSMs.  However, what makes them different
is that the PIM is usually translated into
<emphasis>multiple</emphasis> PSMs, and are usually not very tied to
any destination PSM or language.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
Having a PIM which can be translated into multiple PSMs is useful for
two primary reasons:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>having to write the same program for two different
platforms, due either to having heterogenous systems or to
transitioning from a legacy system to a newer system</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>having a single descriptive model translate into
multiple aspects of a system</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The second reason is by far the most important of the two.  For
example, let's say that you have a data model that you want to use in
a C++ database program.  With a platform independent model, you can
write a single source file and have it translate into multiple aspects
of the final system.  For example, the data model could translate
into:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>a skeleton C++ class, including operations for
serializing the class to the database</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>an SQL script for creating the database on which the
data model is based</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a simple user-interface for data
loading</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
So, from a single platform-independent model, you would get three
separate platform-specific models.  Note that there is no real
difference between a platform-specific model and code, it is merely
one of degree.  The important idea is that of translating a single
source file into multiple platform-specific ones, each covering a
different aspect of the system.
</para>

<para>
Coding in the Model Driven Architecture requires that the programmer
be able to program on all three levels based on the task at hand, and
perhaps even be able to write translators between source models and
destination models.  Some parts of an application will be able to be
written as a Platform-Independent model, where most of the legwork
will be done by the metaprogramming system.  Other parts will be done
as a Platform-Specific model, where the features of the model will be
heavily tied to the purpose and abilities of the language.  Finally,
some things will have to be written in code, as usual.  The benefits
to the Model Driven Architecture are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>that the models for the system have continued
usefulness for the life of the software</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>that much of the redundancy that is common in
applications with multiple aspects is eliminated</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>that communication between the programmer, other
programmers, and domain experts is enhanced</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<sect1>
<title>A Short Example Using xDoclet</title>

<para>
One of the most interesting things about the Model Driven Architecture
is that while there are specifications involved, it is at its core
mostly an idea, a vision, and a process.  A tool is an MDA tool if it
implements some or all of the vision of the MDA.  Of course, being an
OMG standard UML is the preferred modelling language.  But the vision
of MDA greatly supercedes the technologies that it uses.
</para>

<para>
For this example, we are going to use the open-source tool
<emphasis>xDoclet</emphasis>.  xDoclet can be considered a "poor-man's
MDA tool".  It is more platform-specific than is envisioned
by the MDA architects, but it does showcase one of the primary
features of the Platform-Independent Model: generating multiple
aspects of a program from a single source file.
</para>

<para>
In Java Enterprise Edition, one of the primary features is what are
known as Enterprise Java Beans, or EJBs.  These are modular,
database-persisted components that can be easily plugged in to
different systems.  Unfortunately, they take a lot of coding.  To
write a single-function EJB (specifically, for an entity bean), you
have to write the following files: 
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>a local or remote "home" interface class used for lifecycle
management of local or remote instances</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a local or remote component interface class used for
client operations.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a special primary key class if the primary key for the
object if it is a composite type</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>thhe actual class itself which does the major
work</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>an XML deployment descriptor which tells the system about
your EJB</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>an SQL script to create the necessary database
tables</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
If that looks like a lot of redundant, error-prone typing, it is!  It
is also three separate languages to work with: Java, XML, and SQL.
</para>

<para>
However, it should also be clear that, despite the crossover among
languages and the many source files, there is a clear pattern to what
is being developed, which indicates that it is very ripe for
metaprogramming use.  Here enters xDoclet, which will produce for us
all of the files we will need from a single textual model.  While this
is more platform-specific than most Platform-Independent Models, the
defining characteristic of a PIM is still there: generating multiple
aspects of a system from a single source file.
</para>

<para>
Here is the single source file that xDoclet will use to create all the
others: 
</para>

<example>
<title>Example MDA Source File using xDoclet</title>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[

]]>
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>
From this, all of the needed files will be generated.  In more
sophisticated tools, even this would be unnecessary, as all you would
really need to do is do a completely platform-independent graphical model of the data, write
one or two custom methods, choose that you want to build on the JEE
platform, and everything would then be generated automatically for you
from your graphical model.  But this example is useful to help
understand the ideas of the MDA, even if it doesn't implement all of
the nifty and graphical features that are normally expected in an MDA
tool.
</para>

<title>Conclusion</title>

<para>
To review, we've covered:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the limits and promises of metaprogramming systems</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>what sets enterprise metaprogramming apart from other types of metaprogramming</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>what the basic concepts of the Model Driven Architecture are</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
As you can see, the Model Driven Architecture is a powerful idea. 
It is both rooted in a strong tradition of metaprogramming, and yet goes 
beyond traditional methods using its idea of platform-independent 
models.
