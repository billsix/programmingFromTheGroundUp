<title>Introduction to Playstation 3 / CBE Programming</title>
<para>
In the previous parts of the series, we covered programming using the PowerPC 64-bit instruction set.  This instruction set is used on numerous processors, including the POWER4, POWER5, and the Cell Broadband Engine -- the chip used in the new Playstation 3.  However, the PowerPC is only one element of the Cell Broadband Engine.  The Cell actually consists of 9 elements -- a single dual-core Power Processing Element (PPE), and eight Synergistic Processing Elements (SPE), which are essentially general-purpose vector processing elements.   Like the PPE, the SPE can be programmed in a number of programming languages, including C and assembly language.  However, even more so than with the PPE, SPEs give the programmer a lot more control to squeeze every ounce of processing power out of it.  Therefore, while not strictly necessary, learning to program the SPE in assembly language will train your mind to program more efficiently for this processor in any language.  This article assumes that the reader has a solid understanding of PowerPC assembly language, as most concepts will be introduced in relation to their PowerPC counterparts.  This first article will not cover the optimization aspects, but rather lay the groundwork for future articles.

<sect1>
<title>What is an SPE?</title>
<para>
The Synergistic Processing Element (SPE), is a general-purpose vector processor with some unusual characteristics which help it to operate at high speeds with low memory consumption.  For starters, it does not have the interrupt facilities available on the PowerPC.  This means that it is incapable of performing operating-system tasks or time-sharing.  Those features have been sacrificed for the ability to go at high speeds with low power consumptions.  Even more importantly, they do not have any virtual memory features, and in fact can only reference a small 256K local store, which must hold both the program and data.  Memory is transferred between the local store and main memory using DMA.  Other differences between the the PPE and the SPE are listed below:
</para>
<table>
<title>Some Differences Between PPEs and SPEs</title> 
<tr><th></th><th>PPE</th><th>SPE</th></tr>
<tr><th># General-Purpose Registers</th><td>32 fixed-point and 32 floating-point</td><td>128 general-purpose (capable of either floating or fixed)</td></tr>
<tr><th>Register Size</th><td>64 bits</td><td>128 bits</td></tr>
<tr><th>Maximum Memory Size</th><td>Practically Unlimited</td><td>256K</td></tr>
<tr><th>Virtual Memory?</th><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><th>Interrupt Facilities?</th><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><th>Capable of Direct File I/O?</th><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>
<para>
As you can see, the differences between the PPE and the SPE means that they will be used and programmed much differently.  The PPE is used for most general-purpose operating system tasks, timesharing, and maintaining system resources.  The SPEs are used for specialized numeric processing of small batches of data, which are shuffled in and out of local store from main memory using DMA operations.

<title>A Simple Example Program</title>

<para>
To begin with, we will enter in a simple program for calculating the factorial of a 32-bit number using a recursive algorithm.  Unfortunately, it will only return the result as the exit code, so the result must be less than 256.
</para>

<para>
For reference, here is the C code which would perform the same function:
</para>

<example>
<title>C Version of Factorial Program</title>
<programlisting>
int number = 4;
int main() {
	return factorial(4);
}
int factorial(int num) {
	if(num == 0) {
		return 1;
	} else {
		return num * factorial(num - 1);
	}
}

        ##NOTE -- some special tricks are in use here to reduce

        ##PROLOGUE##
        #Before we set up our stack frame,
        #store link register in caller's frame
        stqd $lr, LR_OFFSET($sp)
        #Store back pointer before reserving the stack space
        stqd $sp, -FRAME_SIZE($sp)

        #Return

</programlisting>
</example>

<para>
To build the program, we will just use the C compiler:
</para>

<programlisting>
spu-gcc -o factorial factorial.s
</programlisting>

<para>
Now, the Cell does not run SPE programs directly.  It actually requires that the main code be written for the PPE to manage resources.  However, Linux will, if given an SPE-only program, create a skeleton PPE process to manage the SPE program for you.  So you can just run the program as normal:
</para>

<programlisting>
./factorial
echo $?
</programlisting>

<para>
Don't be taken back by the size of the code -- it's mostly comments and declarations.  The factorial function itself only has 16 instructions.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Analyzing the Program</title>

<para>
Now let's take a look at what each instruction does, and how programming on the SPE differs from programming on the PPE which we have done in previous articles.
</para>

<para>
The program starts off with a typical data declaration which holds the value we want to compute the factorial of in a space labelled <literal>number</literal>.  However, note that before we define <literal>number</literal>, we align it using <literal>.align 4</literal>.  This aligns the next memory location to a 16-byte (2^4) boundary.  This is critical, as the SPU can only load exactly 16 bytes at a time, aligned to exactly a 16-byte boundary.  If it is given an address that is not at a 16-byte boundary, it simply zeroes out the last four bits of the address before loading to do the alignment.  Therefore, if our value is not properly aligned, it will be loaded somewhere in the register that we probably don't expect.  By aligning it to a 16-byte boundary, we know that it will load into the first four bytes of the register.
</para>

<para>
In the code section, notice that unlike for the PPE, we do not need function descriptors.  We simply declare each function name as being global and tell the assembler that it is a function.  The SPE does not need function descriptors because it is statically linked.  Therefore, global references are done simply as relative offsets rather than going through a table of contents or a global offset table.  
</para>

<para>
The first real instruction we hit is <literal>lqr $3, number</literal>.  This stands for "load quadword relative".  The "quadword" part is a bit redundant, as only quadword loads and stores are allowed on the SPU.  This loads the value in the address <literal>number</literal> into register 3.  Notice that unlike the PPE, in SPE assembly language registers are always prefixed with a dollar sign.  This makes it much easier to spot registers in the code.  Since all registers on the SPU are 16-bytes long, this will load a full 16-byte quadword into the register, even though we are only really concerned with the first 4 bytes of it.
</para>

<para>
The value is loaded into register 3, which happens to also be the register which, like in the PPU ABI, is used to pass the first parameter of a function.  In fact, the register layout of the SPU ABI is very similar conceptually to the PPU ABI.  Here is how the registers are used:
</para>

<table>
<title>Register Usage in the SPU ABI</title>
<tr><th>Register Range</th><th>Type</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Dedicated</td><td>Link Register</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Dedicated</td><td>Stack Pointer</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Volatile</td><td>Environment Pointer (for languages that need one)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3-79</td><td>Volatile</td><td>Function arguments, return values, and general usage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>80-127</td><td>Non-volatile</td><td>Used for local variables.  Must be preserved across function calls.</td></tr>
</table>

<para>
A few things to notice.  First, the SPU has a lot more registers.  Second, the SPU doesn't use a special-purpose register for the link register.  Instead, it just uses register 0 and provides a generic indirect branch utility that can use any register  (we'll get to that later).  Volatile and non-volatile registers are used just like in the PPU ABI.  Volatile registers don't need to be saved, but should also be assumed to be overwritten on any function call.  Non-volatile registers have to be saved on the stack before use, and restored before the function returns.  We will discuss the stack shortly.
</para>

<para>
Therefore, since we want the factorial of the number 4, it goes into register 3, the register used for the first parameter.  We then branch to the function use <literal>br factorial</literal>.  This isn't the instruction normally used for function calls, but it keeps us from having to set up a stack frame for <literal>main</literal>.  <literal>br</literal> stands for <emphasis>branch relative</emphasis>, and it is an unconditional branch to an address relative to the address of the current instruction.  
</para>

<para>
For the <literal>factorial</literal> function itself, the program sets up several definitions.  First of all, it defines the size of its stack frame in the symbol <literal>FRAME_SIZE</literal>.  Because SPEs are statically linked and have many more memory constraints than PPEs, the SPE stack frame is both simpler and typically smaller.  The layout of the stack frame looks like this:
</para>

<table>
<tr><th>Contains</th><th>Size</th><th>Beginning Stack Offset</th></tr>
<tr><td>Register Save Area</td><td>Varies (multiple of 16 bytes)</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Local Variable Space</td><td>Varies (multiple of 16 bytes)</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Parameter List</td><td>Varies (multiple of 16 bytes)</td><td>32($sp)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Link Register Save Area</td><td>16 bytes</td><td>16($sp)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Back Chain Pointer</td><td>16 bytes</td><td>0($sp)</td></tr>
</table>

<para>
The stack areas work just as they did on the PPE.  The back chain pointer points to the back chain pointer of the previous stack frame.  The link register save area holds the link register contents of the function being called, rather than for the current function.  The parameter list is for parameters that this function sends to other function calls, not for its own parameters.  However, unlike the PPE, no space is reserved for parameters passed through registers.  This is purely an overflow area for functions requiring more than 77 registers to hold their parameters.  The local variable space is used as a general storage area for the function, and the register save area is used to save the values of non-volatile registers that the function uses.
</para>

<para>
So, in our function, we are using the back chain pointer, the link register save area, and one local variable.  That gives us a frame size of 16 * 3 = 48 bytes.  <literal>LR_OFFSET</literal> is the offset from the top of the stack to the link register save area.  <literal>LCL_NUM_VALUE</literal> is the offset from the top of the stack to our local variable <literal>num</literal>.
</para>

<para>
In the prologue, the first thing we do is to save the link register.  Since we have not yet defined our own stack frame, the offset is from the calling function's stack frame.  Remember, the link register is stored in the calling function's stack frame, not the function's own stack frame.  Therefore, it makes most sense to save it before reserving the stack space.  This is done using a D-Form store: <literal>stqd $lr, LR_OFFSET($sp)</literal>.  Now, this looks like we are using special registers, but in fact <literal>$lr</literal> and <literal>$sp</literal> are just aliases for <literal>$0</literal> and <literal>$1</literal>, respectively.  <literal>stqd</literal> stands for "store quadword d-form".  The SPU has the same basic addressing options as the PPU: d-form for register+constant addressing, x-form for register+register addressing, relative addressing, absolute addressing, and immediate mode.  For more information on these addressing modes, see the PPU article on the subject.(FIXME -- ref!)  So, this stores the link register (which is usually set in the function-call instruction) into the appropriate place in the stack.  Next, the current stack frame pointer is stored as the back pointer for the next stack frame, even though we haven't established the stack frame yet (this is done through negative offsets).  The SPU does not have an atomic store/update instruction like the PPU, so in order to make sure that the back pointers are always consistent, storing the back pointer must be done <emphasis>before</emphasis> the stack pointer is moved.  Finally, the stack pointer is moved to reserve all the needed stack space using the instruction <literal>ai $sp, $sp, -FRAME_SIZE</literal>.  <literal>ai</literal> stands for "add immediate", and it adds an immediate-mode value to a register and stores it back into a register.  Just like the PPU, SPU computation instructions have a destination register that can be specified.
</para>

<para>
One more note needs to be made about the "add immediate" instruction.  Remember that the SPU registers are 128 bits wide, but our value is only 32 bits long.  The reason for this is that the SPU is geared towards SIMD (single instruction multiple data) execution.  The register is treated logically as multiple values, which are operated on all-at-once.  The "add immediate" instruction actually treats the register as four separate 32-bit values, each of which are added independently and then they are all stored back into the destination register.  What this means is that, for example, a carry from one part of the add instruction will not affect the rest of the computations.  It treats them all as separate computations.  The preferred value is a 32 bit word, but others are supported, including bytes, halfwords, and doublewords.  If the size of the operand is not specified in the instruction, that means either that the size doesn't matter (as in logical instructions, for instance) or that it is using a 32-bit value size.  Bytes are indicated by including the letter <literal>b</literal> in the instruction, halfwords have an <literal>h</literal>, and doublewords have a <literal>d</literal>, though doublewords are usually only used in floating-point instructions.
